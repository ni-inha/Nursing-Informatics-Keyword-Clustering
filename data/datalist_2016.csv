2016,Clinical IT to Promote eHealth,Paper,Determining Optimal Nursing Resources in Relation to Functions During the Oulu University Hospital Nurse Staffing Management Project,Pia Liljamo,P?ivi Lavander and Pirjo Kejonen,"The Oulu University Hospital's staffing management project sought information on the number of nursing staff in relation to treatment days and visits, using existing indicators to describe the activities involved. The retrospective data obtained was compared to human resources and the personnel structure. On this basis an optimal number of staff was determined for the units, taking account of a range of explanatory indicator data. The project made use of the computational model for nurse staffing and the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) method. The project provided extensive information on human resources issues within the units. Its results indicated the differences between wards with respect to the number and structure of resources. In addition, the nurse administrators lacked skills in gathering and using data from administrative datasets. This information will provide support for the further development of nursing operations and nursing management decision-making.","Nursing staff, personnel staffing and scheduling, workload, WISNmodel, management information systems"

The frequently used sources were Internet” and “personal experiences”(54.8% and 48.2% respectively). English medical journals” (61.9%) and “English textbooks” (41.3%) were the least frequently used sources. Nurses felt high confidence in sources such as “International instructions/guidelines” (58.6%) and “English medical textbooks” (50.4%). The main reasons for selecting sources were easy accessibility, being up to date and reliability. Google, Pubmed and Up to Date were the most used electronic sources. In addition, there were differences in terms of using some of these resources and nurse’ age and gender. In developing information sources for nurses, factors such as reliability level, availability, and updatedness of resources should be more emphasized.","nurse, evidence based practice, information, information seeking"
,,Paper,Homecare Nurses’ Decision-Making During Admission Care Planning,Paulina Sockolow,"Ellen J. Bass, Carl L. Eberle and Kathryn H. Bowles","The re-hospitalization rate of homecare patients within 60 days of hospital discharge is 30%. Enhanced care planning based on better information may reduce this rate. However, very little is known about the homecare admission and care planning processes. The research team collected data during observations of three nursing visits to admit homecare patients in Camden NJ, and conducted thematic content analysis on these data. Human factors methods helped to identify nurse decision-making related to selection of the plan of care problems, non-nursing resources, and the nursing visit pattern. They identified how the electronic health record (EHR) assisted the nurse in visit pattern frequency decisions. Major themes that emerged included reduced efficiency due to use of redundant intra-team communication methods to augment EHR documentation, redundant documentation, and workarounds and reorganization of clinical workflow.",Evaluation studies; technology evaluation; clinical information systems; patient care team; aged; homecare.
,,Paper,Online Information Seeking Behaviour by Nurses and Physicians: A Cross-Sectional Study,Paschalina Lialiou,John Mantas,"Online bibliographic databases constitute the access to information supporting evidence-based practice. The purpose of the present survey is to evaluate the awareness, the use and the impact that online evidences have in clinical practice. An online survey was conducted using a 25 item questionnaire which was completed by 263 healthcare practitioners (nurses and doctors). Chisquare analysis and t-tests were used and comparisons between both groups were made. Multiple logistic regression to predict databases use was employed. Ninetythree percent (n=206) of participants had heard about the online bibliographic databases; 5.7% of participant sample have heard about online databases but they do not use them. 18.3% was the total sample of non-users(n=48). The main reason of using was filling a knowledge gap (50.7%), and the main reasons of not using were both that they use another information source and they don’t need them to do their job. Both nurses and doctors believe that the use of online databases improves patient care it is a part of their legitimate clinical role. They need more training to improve their searching skills, enhancing them in everyday clinical place.","Online evidence, online bibliographic databases, information retrieval, use of evidence."
,,Paper,Studying the HIT-Complexity Interchange,Craig E. Kuziemsky,Elizabeth M. Borycki and Andre W. Kushniruk,"The design and implementation of health information technology (HIT) is challenging, particularly when it is being introduced into complex settings. While complex adaptive system (CASs) can be a valuable means of understanding relationships between users, HIT and tasks, much of the existing work using CASs is descriptive in nature. This paper addresses that issue by integrating a model for analyzing task complexity with approaches for HIT evaluation and systems analysis. The resulting framework classifies HIT-user tasks and issues as simple, complicated or complex, and provides insight on how to study them.","Complexity, health information technology, usability testing, clinical simulation, naturalistic observations, technology-induced errors"

,,Paper,A Quantitative Study Investigating the Effects of Computerised Clinical Decision Support in the Emergency Department,Paula Bennett,Nicholas Hardiker,"This paper describes the evaluation of a computerized clinical decision support system (CCDSS) for Emergency Department (ED) triage. The CCDSS for triage was developed as a means to improve ED quality and safety. Whilst there is significant research on the role of CCDSS in health care, their role in EDs remains under-investigated. In this study, a CCDSS for ED triage was developed and evaluated using a quasi-experimental interrupted time-series design. Data was collected at four time points before and after the introduction of the CCDSS to assess key aspects of quality and safety within the ED. The results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in triage prioritization (p<0.001), pain scoring (p<0.001) and pain management (p<0.001). This study clearly identifies the positive clinical impact that a CCDSS can have on quality and safety for ED patients and provides a unique contribution to the current knowledge base.

,,Paper,An Analysis of the Factor Model on the Workload of Nursing Staff Using a Hospital Management Tool,Kikue Sato,"Koji Yamashita, Mituko Goshima, Tomohiro Kuroda, Yasutomi Kinosada and Akitoshi Seiyama","We developed a tool that allows a medical facility to offer efficient nursing care with limited human resources by optimizing the distribution of hospital ward nursing tasks. The use of information and communications technology to visualize daily workloads and make use of quantified workload data is important for identifying management elements that allow the efficient allocation of personnel and tasks. The goal of this study was to utilize data from the ward management tool that we developed to consider workflow processes for nursing staff and the relationships between the nursing competence of the nursing staff and the patients' conditions and how these impact on workloads. We found a correlation between workload and staff competence. With respect to the teamwork index and patient condition, structural equation modeling analysis using the intensity of nursing care needs and degree of independent daily living showed that patient condition had a meaningful effect on workload.","Workload, staff assignment, nursing competence, ICT tool, structural equation modeling."

,,Paper,Biometric Attendance and Big Data Analysis for Optimizing Work Processes,Neetu Verma,Teenu Xavier and Deepak Agrawal,"Although biometric attendance management is available, large healthcare organizations have difficulty in big data analysis for optimization of work processes. The aim of this project was to assess the implementation of a biometric attendance system and its utility following big data analysis. In this prospective study the implementation of biometric system was evaluated over 3 month period at our institution. Software integration with other existing systems for data analysis was also evaluated. Implementation of the biometric system could be successfully done over a two month period with enrollment of 10,000 employees into the system. However generating reports and taking action this large number of staff was a challenge. For this purpose software was made for capturing the duty roster of each employee and integrating it with the biometric system and adding an SMS gateway. This helped in automating the process of sending SMSs to each employee who had not signed in. Standalone biometric systems have limited functionality in large organizations unless it is meshed with employee duty roster.","Biometric attendance, software, big data analysis"
,,Paper,Networking Hospital ePrescribing: A Systemic View of Digitalization of Medicines’ Use in England,Valentina Lichtner,Ralph Hibberd and Tony Cornford,"Medicine management is at the core of hospital care and digitalization of prescribing and administration of medicines is often the focus of attention of health IT programs. This may be conveyed to the public in terms of the elimination of paper-based drug charts and increased readability of doctors’ prescriptions. Based on analysis of documents about hospital medicines supply and use (including systems’ implementation) in the UK, in this conceptual paper electronic prescribing and administration are repositioned as only one aspect of an important wider transformation in medicine management in hospital settings, involving, for example, procurement, dispensing, auditing, waste management, research and safety vigilance. Approaching digitalization from a systemic perspective has the potential to uncover the wider implications of this transformation for patients, the organization and the wider health care system.","ePrescribing, CPOE, innovation, transformational change, value"
,,Paper,Evaluating Nurses Acceptance of Hospital Information Systems: A Case Study of a Tertiary Care Hospital,Mohamed Khalifa,,"This study aims at evaluating hospital information systems (HIS) acceptance factors among nurses, in order to provide suggestions for successful HIS implementation. The study used mainly quantitative survey methods to collect data directly from nurses through a questionnaire. The availability of computers in the hospital was one of the most influential factors, with a special emphasis on the unavailability of laptop computers and computers on wheels to facilitate immediate data entry and retrieval when nurses are at the point of care. Nurses believed that HIS might frequently slow down the process of care delivery and increase the time spent by patients inside the hospital especially during slow performance and responsiveness phases. Recommendations were classified into three main areas; improving system performance and availability of computers in the hospital, increasing organizational support in the form of providing training and protected time for nurses’ to learn and enhancing users’ feedback by listening to their complaints and considering their suggestions.","Hospital Information Systems, Acceptance, Satisfaction, Nurses."
,,Paper,Using Mixed Methods in Health Information Technology Evaluation,Paulina Sockolow,"Dawn Dowding, Rebecca Randell and Jesus Favela","With the increasing adoption of interactive systems in healthcare, there is a need to ensure that the benefits of such systems are formally evaluated. Traditionally quantitative research approaches have been used to gather evidence on measurable outcomes of health technology. Qualitative approaches have also been used to analyze how or why particular interventions did or did not work in specific healthcare contexts. Mixed methods research provides a framework for carrying out both quantitative and qualitative approaches within a single research study. In this paper an international group of four informatics scholars illustrate some of the benefits and challenges of using mixed methods in evaluation. The diversity of the research experience provides a broad overview of approaches in combining robust analysis of outcome data with qualitative methods that provide an understanding of the processes through which, and the contexts in which, those outcomes are achieved. This paper discussed the benefits that mixed methods brought to each study.","Mixed methods, evaluation studies, health information technology, interactive systems"

,,Paper,Using Clinical Decision Support and Dashboard Technology to Improve Heart Team Efficiency and Accuracy in a Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) Program,Sarah Clarke,Marisa L. Wilson and Mary Terhaar,"Heart Team meetings are becoming the model of care for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantations (TAVI) worldwide. While Heart Teams have potential to improve the quality of patient care, the volume of patient data processed during the meeting is large, variable, and comes from different sources. Thus, consolidation is difficult. Also, meetings impose substantial time constraints on the members and financial pressure on the institution. We describe a clinical decision support system (CDSS) designed to assist the experts in treatment selection decisions in the Heart Team. Development of the algorithms and visualization strategy required a multifaceted approach and end-user involvement. An innovative feature is its ability to utilize algorithms to consolidate data and provide clinically useful information to inform the treatment decision. The data are integrated using algorithms and rule-based alert systems to improve efficiency, accuracy, and usability. Future research should focus on determining if this CDSS improves patient selection and patient outcomes.",Computerized Decision Support; Heart Team; Medical Informatics; TAVI; user-computer interface
,,Paper,Enhancing Patient Safety Using Clinical Nursing Data: A Pilot Study,Jeeyae Choi,Jeungok E. Choi,"To enhance patient safety from falls, many hospital information systems have been implemented to collect clinical data from the bedside and have used the information to improve fall prevention care. However, most of them use administrative data not clinical nursing data. This necessitated the development of a web-based Nursing Practice and Research Information Management System (NPRIMS) that processes clinical nursing data to measure nurses’ delivery of fall prevention care and its impact on patient outcomes. This pilot study developed computer algorithms based on a falls prevention protocol and programmed the prototype NPRIMS. It successfully measured the performance of nursing care delivered and its impact on patient outcomes using clinical nursing data from the study site. Results of the study revealed that NPRIMS has the potential to pinpoint components of nursing processes that are in need of improvement for preventing patient from falls.","Quality improvement, nursing care, health information systems, delivery of nursing care"
,,Paper,The Integrated Patient’s Self-Care Process Model,Marija Milavec Kapun,Olga ?uster?i? and Vladislav Rajkovi?,"Long-term care is more efficient and effective when it involves the active participation of the empowered patient and informal caregivers. To achieve this, it is necessary to guide the patient and informal caregivers through the systematic process of self-care. Well-documented observations and assessments are fundamental to plan further interventions of the interdisciplinary team. A systematic literature review revealed that the self-care process and the support of information technology are focused on just one chronic disease. Defined self-care process has a positive impact on the functionality and satisfaction of patients with comorbidity and on their caregivers. The model of the patient’s self-care process should be an integral part of the long-term care.","long-term care, self-care, process, model, patient, chronic disease"

The evaluation of a NIS deployment in a German University Hospital supports this assumption. A second side study in the US should point out the differences regarding the technical and organizational differences. We use a questionnaire including standardized instruments like the Unified Theory of Acceptance (UTAUT). Results indicated that nurses in Germany compared to in the US do not use nursing process documentation to the same extent. The main reasons behind the low usage in comparison with the US are deficits in ease-of-use, system performance and the high expenditure of time and paper work for charting nursing plans.","Evaluation study, Acceptance model, Clinical information systems, Technology Acceptance"

Heart Failure (HF) is one of the conditions included in the comparison, as it is the most frequent and the most expensive diagnosis for hospitalization. If risk stratification for readmission of HF patients could be carried out at the time of discharge from the index hospitalization, corresponding appropriate post-discharge interventions could be arranged. We, therefore, sought to compare two different risk prediction models using 48 clinical predictors from electronic health records data of 1037 HF patients from one hospital. We used logistic regression and random forest as methods of analyses and found that logistic regression with bagging approach produced better predictive results (C-Statistics: 0.65) when compared to random forest (C-Statistics: 0.61).","Predictive models, readmission, heart failure, Electronic Health Records, Logistic Regression, Random Forest"

We developed this structure based NursingNAVI® contents collaborated with some quality centred hospitals. Authors analysed the nursing care documentations of post-gastrectomy patients in light of the standardized nursing care plan in the “NursingNAVI®” developed by ourselves and revealed the “failure to observe” and “failure to document”, which leaded to the volatility of the patients’ data, conditions and some situation. This phenomenon should have been avoided if nurses had employed a standardized nursing care plan. So, we developed thinking process support system for planning, delivering, recording and evaluating in daily nursing using NursingNAVI® contents. It is important to identify the problem of the volatility of the patients’ data, conditions and some situation. We developed a survey tool of nursing documents using NursingNAVI® Content for quality evaluation of nursing observation. We recommended some hospitals to use this survey tool. Fifteen hospitals participated the survey using this tool. It is estimated that the volatilizing situation. A hospital which don’t participate this survey, knew the result. So the hospital decided to use NursingNAVI® contents in HIS.

Considering the important role of nurses in providing healthcare services as well as in future long term plans such as sustainable development, it is of high value to pay attention to nurses’ contribution in developing eHealth strategies. Thus the purpose of this study was to investigate nurses’ contribution to health information technology of Iran’s 2025 health map. This study was a qualitative study conducted in 2015 through reviewing the “Iran’ 2025 Health Map: Health Information Technology” official report. The strategy published in three volumes and in Persian language was downloaded through the official website of the office of Statistics and Information Technology of Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME). Two main themes were identified in the report indicating areas which nurses’ roles were clearly stated. The findings revealed that nurses’ contribution is not clearly stated in the strategy. However, there are a few areas highlighting nurses’ involvement such as “determining beneficiary groups” and “information dissemination”. It is suggested that more attention needs to be paid in contribution of nurses in further actions to revise the Iran’s eHealth strategy.","Nurses, Contribution, Iran’s 2025 Health Map, Health Information Technology, eHealth Strategy, Document Review"

,,Paper,Use of Patient Portals in Older Adults: A Comparison of Three Samples,Eun-Shim Nahm,Knar Sagherian and Shijun Zhu,"Recently, there have been national efforts to use patient portals (PPs) to engage patients in their care. Through PPs, patient can access their health records and communicate with care providers. These functions can be beneficial for older adults who manage multiple chronic conditions. The current nationwide PP implementation, however, lacks strategies for facilitating PP use in older adults. As a first step to fill this gap, this study examined the prevalence of PP use among older adults, the demographic characteristics of older adult PP users, and self-efficacy for using PPs using three samples (two national, one local). Findings suggest that older adult online users are receptive to PPs and can use them like other age groups. Approaches to engage older adults in PP use may differ from those for younger adults, as they have additional support needs. Further research is needed to identify optimal approaches to support older adult populations.","patient portal, older adults, health information technology"

Wilson and Mary Terhaar,"This review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of evidence for the use of clinical dashboards and clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in multidisciplinary teams. A literature search was performed for the dates 2004-2014 on CINAHL, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library. A citation search and a hand search of relevant papers were also conducted. (One hundred and twelve full text papers were retrieved of which 22 were included in the review.) There was considerable heterogeneity in setting, users, and indicators utilized. Information on usability and human-computer interaction was thoroughly reviewed. There was evidence that dashboards were associated with improved care processes when end-user input was incorporated and information was concurrent, pertinent and intuitive. There is some evidence that implementing clinical dashboards and/or CDSS that provide immediate access to current patient information for clinicians can improve processes and patient outcomes.","Clinical dashboard, review, clinical decision support systems"

Detailed Clinical Models (DCM) are used for this purpose, however, what is their quality? This paper’s objective is to report on the application of an existing instrument to determine DCM quality. A selection of 9 DCMs about oncology care was tested using the ‘Quality Metrics for DCM’. The instrument revealed scores per DCM varying from 16 to 26, rendering one DCM insufficient and five requiring upgrading. The instrument proved practical in its administration and revealed useful feedback for DCM improvement. A core part of a DCM, the actual specification of data elements, is not included in the instrument and is suggested to be added.","Electronic Health Records, Medical Records Systems, Health Care/standards, Detailed Clinical Models, Electronic Messages, HL7 v3."

Jonas","In recent years the need for informal home care in European countries is growing quickly due to increased life expectancy and demographic change. Informal caregivers have to overcome many obstacles ranging from a lack of adequate training to misjudging their physical and psychological abilities. The aim of this project is to create a low cost wearable device, which unobtrusively measures the physical stress load on caregivers. Two parameters with the most impact on performance and well-being of the caregiver have been identified: fatigue and back-stress. Based on the measurements, an alert is issued if caregivers are not performing a task correctly, or if they are overexerting themselves. This paper discusses the design of such device and description of an initial prototype, its advantages and possible further development and applications.","LillyPad, fatigue, homecare, signal processing, low-cost"

A Pilot Study,Michael Marschollek,"Christoph Barthel, Marianne Behrends, Regina Schmeer, Iris Meyenburg-Altwarg and Marcus Becker","Heavy workloads in nursing care and high employee turnover call for efficient methods to support on-the-job training. Within the Witra Care project ? aiming to develop mobile technologies to support knowledge transfer between experienced and inexperienced nurses ? the objective was to investigate the feasibility and perceived usefulness of advanced smart glasses for an exemplary, specific activity in nursing training ? preparation of a surgical instrument table in an operating room. Four trainee nurses performed different tasks using speech-command operated smart glasses within an operating room setting and were asked for their expectations towards this technology, their experiences and perceptions. All tasks could be achieved by the trainee nurses, and the overall perception was that the technology is supportive and helpful. Our results indicate interest in new wearable technologies for supporting training in nursing care. Limitations include small sample size, selection bias and several technical issues such as speech recognition accuracy or short battery lifetime.

The translation of cancer research into clinical practice is hindered by the lack of integration of heterogeneous and autonomous data from various data sources. Integration of heterogeneous data can offer researchers a comprehensive source for biospecimen identification, hypothesis formulation, hypothesis validation, cohort discovery and biomarker discovery. Alongside the increasing prominence of big data, various translational research tools such as tranSMART have emerged that can converge and analyse different types of data. In this study, we show the integration of different data types from a significant Australian colorectal cancer cohort. Additionally, colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas were also integrated for comparison. These integrated data are accessible via http://www.tcrn.unsw.edu.au/transmart.

We then tested their understandability by surveying 42 volunteers recruited at a senior wellness center in San Diego, CA. Lower level of comprehension was observed in all 7 new composite pictograms when compared to the USP pictograms with similar styles. No consistent socio-demographic effect on the comprehension of the pictograms was discerned. The major sources of misinterpretations were (1) misunderstanding the main action depicted in the image, (2) ignoring the conditional information, and (3) making an incorrect semantic association between the main information and the conditional information. Design rules from the validated set of pictograms might serve as the starting point for creating a new health pictogram. However, rigorous validation and revision of the initial design should follow.","Medication instruction, health pictograms, composite pictograms, patient education, health literacy"

This study evaluates the suitability of three statistical methods for identifying nursing outliers. The results show that by using methods implemented in the nursing workload measurement system “LEP” with reference to real data, unusual LEP minute profiles (movement, nutrition and so on) can be identified with little effort and therefore seem promising for application to the health services' daily evaluation process. The lessons learned are used to create requirement criteria for the further development of software solutions. It is recommended that the methods for identifying outliers in the daily evaluation process should be standardized in order to increase the efficiency of secondary use of care data from patient record.","Secondary use of Care Data, Evaluation of Care Data, Identification of Outliers, Statistical Methods, Diagnosis Related Groups, Nursing Workload.

,,Paper,Advancing the Digital Health Discourse for Nurse Leaders,Sally Remus,,"Limited informatics competency uptake is a recognized nursing leadership challenge impacting digital practice settings. The health system’s inability to reap the promised benefits of EHRs is a manifestation of inadequate development of informatics competencies by chief nurse executives (CNEs) and other clinicians. Through the application of Transformational Leadership Theory (TL), this discussion paper explains how informatics competencies enable CNEs to become transformational nursing leaders in digital health allowing them to meet their accountabilities to lead integrated, high-quality care delivery through evidence based practices (EBPs). It is proposed that successful CNE eHealth sponsors will be those armed with informatics competencies who can drive health organizations’ investment in technology and innovation. Finally, some considerations are suggested in how nurse informaticists globally play a critical role in preparing our existing and future CNEs to fulfill their transformational leader roles in the digital age.","digital health, informatics competencies, transformational nursing leadership"
,,Paper,Adaptive Practice: Next Generation Evidence-Based Practice in Digital Environments,Margaret Ann Kennedy,,"Evidence-based practice in nursing is considered foundational to safe, competent care. To date, rigid traditional perceptions of what constitutes ‘evidence’ have constrained the recognition and use of practice-based evidence and the exploitation of novel forms of evidence from data rich environments. Advancements such as the conceptualization of clinical intelligence, the prevalence of increasingly sophisticated digital health information systems, and the advancement of the Big Data phenomenon have converged to generate a new contemporary context. In today’s dynamic data-rich environments, clinicians have new sources of valid evidence, and need a new paradigm supporting clinical practice that is adaptive to information generated by diverse electronic sources. This opinion paper presents adaptive practice as the next generation of evidence-based practice in contemporary evidence-rich environments and provides recommendations for the next phase of evolution.","Evidence-based practice, clinical intelligence, electronic health information systems, big data, practice-based evidence, adaptive practice"

To start addressing this challenge, we developed a semantic model of the physical activity domain by reviewing 302 physical activity questions collected from standardized questionnaires and public data repositories. Our semantic model is comprised of activity keywords, qualifiers, response measures and context. We identified three types of contexts: active lifestyle, physical capacity, and environment. The majority (94%) of the 204 activity keywords extracted from the 302 questions were mapped to the UMLS Metathesaurus. Preliminary evaluation of our model with 309 additional activity questions showed that the majority of the questions were related to one of the three context categories. We also noted the need to expand context categories to incorporate the questions assessing psychological aspects of dealing with physical activities.","physical activity, data standardization, data modeling, standardized terminology, data discoverability"

,,Paper,Harmonising Nursing Terminologies Using a Conceptual Framework,Kay Jansen,"Tae Youn Kim, Amy Coenen, Virginia Saba and Nicholas Hardiker","The International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP®) and the Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System are standardised nursing terminologies that identify discrete elements of nursing practice, including nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes. While CCC uses a conceptual framework or model with 21 Care Components to classify these elements, ICNP, built on a formal Web Ontology Language (OWL) description logic foundation, uses a logical hierarchical framework that is useful for computing and maintenance of ICNP. Since the logical framework of ICNP may not always align with the needs of nursing practice, an informal framework may be a more useful organisational tool to represent nursing content. The purpose of this study was to classify ICNP nursing diagnoses using the 21 Care Components of the CCC as a conceptual framework to facilitate usability and inter-operability of nursing diagnoses in electronic health records. Findings resulted in all 521 ICNP diagnoses being assigned to one of the 21 CCC Care Components.

We modified Nielsen’s expert heuristic evaluation method addressing common gaps: a patient perspective and variability in findings. Two expert, dual-domain evaluators referred to validated patient profiles (mild, moderate, severe diabetes) when conducting uniform evaluation processes on a diabetes mHealth system. Evaluators found 103 usability problems and 224 heuristic violations. For 69 % of the problems, the profiles had an effect on severity ratings. “Consistency and Standards” (n=57) and “Match between the System and Real World” (n=55) violations dominated at 50%. The overall system severity rating was major. Severity was highest for a severe diabetic profile due to likely visual issues (crowded elements), cognitive concerns (remembering many steps) and for insufficient medication information. Interrater reliability was respectable at Kappa =0.67.

,,Paper,Towards Integrating the Principlist and Casuist Approaches to Ethical Decisions via Multi-Criterial Support,Mette Kjer Kaltoft,"Jesper Bo Nielsen, Glenn Salkeld and Jack Dowie","An interactive decision support tool based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) can help health professionals integrate the principlist (principle-based) and casuist (case-based) approaches to ethical decision making in both their training and practice. MCDA can incorporate generic ethical principles as criteria; then draw on case-based reasoning as the basis for specifying, in the individual case, the available options, the ratings of each option on each criterion, and the relative weighting of the criteria. This produces a personalised, transparent and decomposable opinion on the merits of each option, as a contribution to enhanced deliberation. As proof of concept and method an exemplar aid adds veracity and confidentiality to beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice, as the criteria, with case-based reasoning supplying the necessary inputs for the decision of whether a nurse should disclose the poor prognosis of a patient to a close relative of the patient, when asked, on their first encounter.",Ethics; principle-based; case-based; multi-criteria; decision support; nursing

Beyond, fitness trackers are more used by individuals to monitor their fitness and health. The health data that is becoming available due to these developments could provide a valuable source for continuous health monitoring, prevention of unexpected health events and clinical decision making since it gives insights into behavior and life habits. However, an integration of the data is challenging. This paper aims triggering the discussion about this current topic. We present a concept for integrating social media data with mobile sensor data and clinical data using digital patient modelling. Further, we collect requirements and challenges for a possible realization of the concept.

Long wait lists to access public clinical pain management services can result, and health outcomes deteriorate. Innovative technologies, such as social media provide opportunities to support self-management within the participatory health framework. This paper aims to investigate patients’ perceptions towards using social media while waiting for clinic access, with a particular focus on therapeutic affordances. Seventeen wait-listed patients underwent intervention using various social media resources as part of self-management. Thematic content analysis of semi-structured interviews examined patients’ perceptions about social media use and participation. Three therapeutic affordances were most evident in the qualitative data: exploration, connection and narration. Barriers to participation were also identified, such as ‘specificity of the resources’. Findings suggest social media are perceived positively. However, there is also the need to balance a desire to deliver evidence-based practice with patient-preferences in shared-decision making about social media use.",Chronic Pain; Chronic Disease; Participatory Health; Patient-Reported Outcomes; Self-Management; Social Media; Thematic Content Analysis; Therapeutic Affordances

,,Paper,"Capturing Provenance, Evolution and Modification of Clinical Protocols via a Heterogeneous, Semantic Social Network",Nick Portokallidis,George Drosatos and Eleni Kaldoudi,"Healthcare delivery is largely based on medical best practices as in clinical protocols. Research so far has addressed the computerized execution of clinical protocols by developing a number of related representation languages, execution engines and integrated platforms to support real time execution. However, much less effort has been put into organizing clinical protocols for use and reuse. In this paper we propose a heterogeneous semantic social network to describe and organize clinical protocols based on their provenance, evolution and modifications. The proposed approach allows semantic tagging and enrichment of clinical protocols so that they can be used and re-used across platforms and also be linked directly to other relevant scientific information, e.g. published works in PubMed or personal health records, and other clinical information systems.","Clinical protocols, semantic social network, ontology, provenance."

,,Poster,Study on Synchronization of the Heart in a Nursing Art,Soh Sakaki,Atsushi Ishigame and Yukie Majima,"Compared to rookie nurses, it is often said that a skilled nurse’s injection is less degree of pain. The authors believe that the reason why the pain is reduced is because skilled nurses can make themselves relaxed and synchronize their state to the patients. So, if we can make people relaxed and synchronized intentionally by giving artificial stimulation, the technique will be so valuable not only in the inheritance of injection skills but also in various medical situations including the care of aged, nursing of infant and so on. In this paper, we focused on the synchronization of brain waves, and examined the method of inducing the relaxed state and the synchronization in brain waves of subjects by giving a vibratory stimulation.","Synchronization, Brain wave, Alpha wave band content, vibratory stimulation, Correlation coefficient."

Lightweight Expression of Granular Objects (LEGOs) represent question/answer pairs on clinical data collection forms, where a question is modeled by a (usually) post-coordinated SNOMED CT expression. LEGOs transform electronic patient data into a normalized consumable, which means that the expressions can be treated as extensions of the SNOMED CT hierarchies for the purpose of performing subsumption queries and other analytics. Utilizing the LEGO approach for modeling clinical data obtained from a nursing admission assessment provides a foundation for data exchange across disparate information systems and software applications. Clinical data exchange of computable LEGO patient information enables the development of more refined data analytics, data storage and clinical decision support.","Electronic clinical data, nursing assessment, lightweight expressions of granular objects, observables model, content modeling"

Matney,"Theresa (Tess) Settergren, Bonnie Westra and Lisiane Pruinelli","A terminology for nursing assessments does not exist to support exchange of information and research. A team of nurse informaticts collaborated to create a standard for medical/ surgical assessment terms coded in LOINC and SNOMED CT. Nursing assessments represented 106 observation (50% new LOINC), and 348 Values (20% New SNOMED CT) organized into fifteen panels (86% new LOINC).","Assessment, LOINC, SNOMED CT, Medical/Surgical Nursing, Nursing Informatics"
