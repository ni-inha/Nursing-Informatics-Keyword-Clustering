2014,Citizen Activation Through eHealth,,Elderly People’s Interaction with Advanced Technology,Helena Bla?un,"Janez Vo?ner, Peter Kokol, Kaija Saranto and Sari Rissanen",Aging of population is an inevitable process by which the number of elderly people is increasing. Rapid development of information and communication technology (ICT) is changing basic needs of elderly people; therefore society should ensure opportunities for elderly to learn and use ICT in a way to manage their daily life activities and in this way enable them participation in the information and knowledge society. The purpose of the study was to find out whether elderly are acquainted with the advanced technology and to what extent they use it or they desire to use it. Within the single point study we interviewed 100 randomly selected elderly people from different geographical regions in Slovenia. Results showed the differences in the use of advanced technology by Slovenian regions; therefore in the future activities should be focused on organizing promotional and demonstrational activities including ICT courses to increase elderly’s motivation for ICT interaction.,"Elderly people, Information and communication technology (ICT), Advanced technology, Computer, World Wide Web (Internet)"
,,,Promoting the Meaningful Use of Health Information for New Zealand Consumers,Michelle Honey,"Dianne Roy, Janine Bycroft, Mary-Anne Boyd and Deborah Raphael","A cornerstone of ‘meaningful use’ of health information is engaging consumers and their families. Yet for consumers to be engaged requires an informed population and therefore focus on consumer’s health information needs. Reports indicated consumers want health information, yet little was known about their internet use or perception of electronic health information. This New Zealand study surveyed consumers to gain an understanding of their health information requirements. Some 1783 questionnaires were available for descriptive statistical analyses. The internet was the third most preferred source of health information. Two thirds of participants had used the internet to access health information, because of the speed of access and to find information before going to the doctor. There was little awareness or use of existing New Zealand-based on-line health resources. Study implications include promoting existing resources and increasing the use of electronic communication between consumers and healthcare providers as these are currently underutilized.","Health information, Consumer, Internet, Survey"
,,,Comparison of Consumer Derived Evidence with an Omaha System Evidence-Based Practice Guideline for Community Dwelling Older Adults,Lisiane Pruinelli,"Helen Fu, Karen A. Monsen and Bonnie L. Westra","Consumer involvement in healthcare is critical to support continuity of care for consumers to manage their health while transitioning from one care setting to another. Validation of evidence-based practice (EBP) guideline by consumers is essential to achieving consumer health goals over time that is consistent with their needs and preferences. The purpose of this study was to compare an Omaha System EBP guideline for community dwelling older adults with consumer-derived evidence of their ongoing needs, resources, and strategies after home care discharge. All identified problems were relevant for all patients except for Neglect and Substance use. Ten additional problems were identified from the interviews, five of which affected at least 10% of the participants. Consumer derived evidence both validated and expanded EBP guidelines; thus further emphasizing the importance of consumer involvement in the delivery of home healthcare.",Evidence-based practice guidelines; nursing care/problems; home care; consumer-derived
,,,Toward a Typology of Technology Users: How Older People Experience Technology’s Potential for Active Aging,Edith Roth Gjevjon,"Tone Øderud, Gro H. Wensaas and Anne Moen","This paper outlines an emerging typology of older users of information and communication technology (ICT) to facilitate active aging. Through inductive data analysis from focus groups, iterative workshops, and personal interviews, we suggest three types of technology users. These types are “the Excluded,” “the Entertained,” and “the Networker.” Clearly, ICT offers several benefits to those who are enthusiastic and frequent users, exemplified as the Entertained and the Networker. Hence, our findings support the notion of technology as a tool to maintain or increase an older person’s engagement and activity level. Conversely, for those reluctant, uninterested, or incapable of using ICT, such potentials are limited and imply fewer opportunities for participation in activities.","Active aging, technology, tablets, user experience, older users, user types"
,Revolutionising Learning with Technology,,Attitudes of Student Nurses Enrolled in E-Learning Course Towards Academic Dishonesty: A Descriptive-Exploratory Study,Jude L. Tayaben,,"The author investigated attitudes of nursing students enrolled in e-Learning towards academic dishonesty. The descriptive- exploratory design was used in the conduct of the study. Respondents were randomly selected 36 junior and senior nursing students. It revealed that nursing students perceived as neutral (mean= 2.77, mean= 3.17) in taking responsibility for promoting academic integrity in e- learning. The paraphrasing a sentence from internet source without referencing it (38.89%) got the most form of cheating. Female and level four (4) nursing students revealed as the most cheaters. The reasons not to cheat, nursing students considered punishment, and education or learning (91.67%) got the highest in ranks, and simply wrong (75%) got the lowest rank. Hence, there is a need to look on how to maintain academic honesty among nursing students in and out of the university with respect to e- learning as a means of teaching- learning method.","Attitudes of student nurses, e- Learning course, academic dishonesty, academic- integrity,responsibility"
,,,Relationship Between Nursing Students’ Preference for Types of Teaching Materials and Learning Effects of Self-Learning Tool,Yasuko Kitajima,"Masako Yamashita, Mitsuhiro Nakamura, Jukai Maeda, Kyouko Aida, Masako Kanai-Pak, Zhifeng Huang, Ayanori Nagata, Taiki Ogata, Noriaki Kuwahara and Jun Ota","The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between learning effects of the self-learning tool for nursing students and types of teaching materials. Ten nursing students were asked to perform transfer a patient from bed to wheelchair after watching the demo video and practicing 20 minutes. The students’ performance was evaluated before and after practicing. The students were also asked to choose teaching materials that would be developed in the future. Out of nine teaching materials, the students chose seven of them. Correspondence analysis was conducted between the results of the evaluation of students’ transfer technique and their preference of teaching materials. The results indicated that there was no relationship between the preference of teaching materials and the scores of transfer techniques. The authors concluded that the self-learning was not affected by the preference of teaching materials.","Self-learning tool, learning effects, teaching materials"
,,,A Virtual Platform for Electronic Health Record (EHR) Education for Nursing Students: Moving from In-House Solutions to the Cloud,Andre W. Kushniruk,"Mu-Hsing Kuo, Eric Parapini and Elizabeth M. Borycki","There is a need to develop cost effective ways to bring hands-on education about essential information technologies, such as electronic health record (EHR) systems to nursing students, nursing faculty and practitioners. This is especially the case as worldwide there is an increased deployment of these systems and they are transforming the practice of healthcare. However, due to technical, financial and knowledge limitations, many nursing schools and programs do not have an adequate way to bring such technology into their classes and curricula. In this paper we describe an approach to developing Web-based EHR education that allows students from any Web-accessible location to access and work with real EHR systems remotely over the Internet for learning purposes. In this paper we describe our work in moving this approach to a cloud-based solution to allow access to EHRs for educational purposes from any location with Web access and to do so in a way that is both educationally sound and cost effective.","electronic health records, nursing education, medical education, health informatics education, cloud computing"

,Infrastructures to Support Big Data,,A Cloud Computing Based Platform for Sleep Behavior and Chronic Diseases Collaborative Research,Mu-Hsing Kuo,"Elizabeth Borycki, Andre Kushniruk, Yueh-Min Huang and Shu-Hui Hung","The objective of this study is to propose a Cloud Computing based platform for sleep behavior and chronic disease collaborative research. The platform consists of two main components: (1) a sensing bed sheet with textile sensors to automatically record patient’s sleep behaviors and vital signs, and (2) a service-oriented cloud computing architecture (SOCCA) that provides a data repository and allows for sharing and analysis of collected data. Also, we describe our systematic approach to implementing the SOCCA. We believe that the new cloud-based platform can provide nurse and other health professional researchers located in differing geographic locations with a cost effective, flexible, secure and privacy-preserved research environment.","Cloud Computing, Service Oriented Architecture, Health Information Technology, Sleep Behavior"
,,,Using a Data Mining Approach to Discover Behavior Correlates of Chronic Disease: A Case Study of Depression,Sunmoo Yoon,Basirah Taha and Suzanne Bakken,"The purposes of this methodological paper are: 1) to describe data mining methods for building a classification model for a chronic disease using a U.S. behavior risk factor data set, and 2) to illustrate application of the methods using a case study of depressive disorder. Methods described include: 1) six steps of data mining to build a disease model using classification techniques, 2) an innovative approach to analyzing high-dimensionality data, and 3) a visualization strategy to communicate with clinicians who are unfamiliar with advanced statistics. Our application of data mining strategies identified childhood experience living with mentally ill and sexual abuse, and limited usual activity as the strongest correlates of depression among hundreds variables. The methods that we applied may be useful to others wishing to build a classification model from complex, large volume datasets for other health conditions.","Data mining, knowledge discovery, depression, modeling, classification, high-dimensional data"
,,,From Capturing Nursing Knowledge to Retrieval of Data from a Data Warehouse,Asta Thoroddsen,Hanna K. Guðj?nsd?ttir and Elisabet Guðmundsd?ttir,"The purpose of the project was to capture nursing data and knowledge, represent it for use and re-use by retrieval from a data warehouse, which contains both clinical and financial hospital data. Today nurses at LUH use standardized nursing terminologies to document information related to patients and the nursing care in the EHR at all times. Pre-defined order sets for nursing care have been developed using best practice where available and tacit nursing knowledge has been captured and coded with standardized nursing terminologies and made explicit for dissemination in the EHR. All patient-nursing data is permanently stored in a data repository. Core nursing data elements have been selected for transfer and storage in the data warehouse and patient-nursing data are now captured, stored, can be related to other data elements from the warehouse and be retrieved for use and re-use.","data warehouse, standardized nursing terminologies, knowledge management, nursing informatics"
,,,Improving Inpatient Fall Prevention Strategies Using Interactive Data Repository Information System,Lichin Chen,"Hui-Chu Yu, Hung-Chang Lee, Yufang Chung, Rung-Ji Shang, Hsiu-Yun Liu, Ching-Ting Tan and Feipei Lai","Observing the pattern changes of inpatient fall and validating the Fall Prevention Tool Kit (FPTK) are essential for developing fall prevention strategies. However, the work requires the collection, calculation, and comparison of large amount of data. The information is often scattered in diverse information systems and lack of integration, which makes the work difficult and often neglected. This study demonstrates the development of an Interactive Data Repository System (IDRS) and uses it in the analysis of the pattern changes of inpatient fall within the institute, and validates efficiency of the FPTK across time. This study collected the incident data of year 2011 and compared it with the previous analysis in 2001. The result shows that reasons for patient fall had turned from physical disability to impaired conscious or cognition. The scoring result may be too sensitive in identifying patient falls. Patients with high scores needed to reinforce in functional strength.","Accidental falls, quality of healthcare, database, patient safety."
,Meaningful Use of Electronic Record Systems for Better Health Care,,Identifying Barriers for Implementation of Computer Based Nursing Documentation,Anna-Maria Vollmer,Hans-Ulrich Prokosch and Thomas B?rkle,"This study was undertaken in the planning phase for the introduction of a comprehensive computer based nursing documentation system at Erlangen University Hospital. There, we expect a wide range of difficult organizational changes, because the nurses currently neither used computer based nursing documentation nor did they follow strongly the nursing process model within paper based documentation. Thus we were eager to recognize potential pitfalls early and to identify potential barriers for digital nursing documentation. In a questionnaire study we surveyed all German university hospitals for their experience with the implementation of computer based nursing documentation implementation. We received answers from 11 of the 23 hospitals. Furthermore we performed a questionnaire study about expectations and fears among the nurses of four pilot wards of our hospital. Most respondents stated a positive attitude towards the nursing process documentation, but many respondents note technical (e.g. bad performance of the software) and organizational barriers (e.g. lack of time).","Barriers, Implementation, Nursing Process Documentation, NIS, Germany"
,,,Clinical Documentation Improvement for Outpatients by Implementing Electronic Medical Records,Ryoma Seto,Toshitaka Inoue and Hiroshi Tsumura,"This observational study was conducted before and after implementing an electronic medical record (EMR) system to evaluate the change in outpatient workflow by implementation of EMR and the effectiveness of clinical documentation improvement (CDI). The number of hours for patient care increased by 89.2% (p<.05) and the hours for writing medical records after consulting decreased after implementation of EMR by27.3% (p<.01). Implementation of EMR reduced nurses’ workload to handle medical records by 78.8 (p<.05) but not changed for physicians. The necessary change in the 
information management process occurred after using the CDI indicator. We recommend that the “working hours of health professionals” and “handling hours for information resources” should be used widely as CDI indicators to improve workflow when implementing EMR.

,,,Promoting Meaningful Use of Health Information Technology in Israel: Ministry of Health Vision,Ayala Gerber,Maxim (Max) Topaz,"The Ministry of Health (MOH) of Israel has overall responsibility for the healthcare system. In recent years the MOH has developed strong capabilities in the areas of technology assessment and prioritization of new technologies. Israel completed the transition to computerized medical records a decade ago in most care settings; however, the processes in Israel was spontaneous, without government control and standards settings, therefore large variations among systems and among organizations were created. Currently, the main challenge is to convert the information scattered in different systems, to organized, visible information and to make it available to various levels in health management. The MOH's solution is of implementing a selected information system from a specific vendor, at all the hospitals and all HMO's clinics, in order to achieve interoperability. The sys-tem will enable access to the patient's medical record history from any location.","Ehealth, ICT, OFEK"
,,,The Impact of Electronic Health Records on Client Safety in Aged Care Homes,Tao Jiang,Ping Yu,This study collects and critically reviews the published literature to synthesize the risk factors for client safety in residential aged care and the potential contributions of electronic health records to reducing these risks. Three major types of risk factors for client safety were identified: risk factors related to the person’s health; those related to the health and aged care system serving the person and those related to human error. Multiple strategies at all levels of an aged care organization are needed to reduce risks and improve client safety. Electronic health records can be one of the effective organizational mechanisms because it improves access to better information and integrates intelligent functions to support point-of-care decision making.,"Electronic health records, EHR, nursing documentation, patient safety, risk, residential aged care, long term care, nursing home"
,Citizen Activation Through eHealth,,Mockup Design of Personal Health Diary App for Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease,Hsiu-Wen Lin,"Yu-Jen Wang, Ling-Fang Jing and Polun Chang","Health self-management is important in the care of patients with chronic kidney disease. It is possible to improve the efficiency of patient self- management through the use of mobile technology and related software. This study is divided into three stages: 1. analysis of need: through observation, interview and content analysis of the chronic kidney disease health management manual; 2. design of system prototype: establish interface and system function; 3. prototype evaluation: evaluate whether the prototype designed by this study meets user needs. The system prototype includes: daily record, laboratory examination results, trend graphs, information search, sharing, communications and settings. Prototyping is done with Pencil Project for interface design and linking. The prototype is then exported in PDF format for mock-up simulation. Evaluation results: overall score was 4.01±0.60 leaning towards “agree”, the highest score was ease of use (4.25±0.6), followed by easy to learn (4.15±0.68), acceptance (4.01±0.61), reliability (3.87±0.6) and functionality (3.83±0.49).

,,,Appreciating the Persona Paradox: Lessons from Participatory Design Sessions with HIV+ Gay Men,Jae-Yung Kwon,J. Craig Phillips and Leanne M. Currie,"Eliciting user requirements from HIV-positive gay men who smoke can be challenging. This is because of the complex relationship between social stigma and gender identities (e.g., gay, masculine, HIV+, and smoking status). Inspired to engage HIV-positive gay men in the development of a web-assisted tobacco intervention, we used personas as a main communication tool in our participatory design sessions. Personas are characters created by users that embody part of their own behaviours, thoughts, and motivations. In an apparent paradox, this article is a description of how the use of personas to ensure less realistic self-representation provided an impetus for more self-disclosure. Findings and feedbacks from this study reveal that personas are an effective design tool to engage users in sensitive topics. Implications for future work are also discussed.","Personas, design tools, participatory design, HIV positive gay men"

Understanding this significance, Healthy People 2020 retained, as a Focus Area, the need for improved interactive Health Communication and HIT. Attainment of this goal includes increasing the use of Internet-based electronic personal health management tools (EPHMT). Health information management, essential for favorable health outcomes, can be problematic in low income, special needs populations with complex chronic illnesses such as HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, barriers to the adoption and acceptance of an EPHMT in such populations have not been well explored.

,Leading uCare Safely,,Evaluation of Use of Electronic Patient Controlled Analgesia Pumps to Improve Patient Safety in an Academic Medical Center,Kumiko Ohashi,"Patricia Dykes, Kathleen McIntosh, Elizabeth Buckley, Catherine Yoon, Carol Luppi, Anne Bane and David W. Bates","Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) and Patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) pumps are methods of pain control with complex smart infusion devices and are widely used in hospitals. Smart PCA/PCEA pumps can be programmed with the dose and rate of medications within pre-set ranges. However, adverse effects have been reported associated with these pumps’ use. In this paper, we describe a prevalence observational study where observers used an electronic data collection tool to record pump settings and medications with PCA pumps, corresponding medication orders to identify errors. The results showed that there were many labeling and tubing change tag errors, which were a violation of hospital policy. A few potential harmful medication errors were identified but no critical errors. Study results suggest the importance of a standard process of PCA pump use. Next steps include implementing a safety bundle for improving PCA practice to support safe and effective pain management.","Smart pump, smart infusion pump, patient safety, patient controlled analgesia, patient controlled epidural analgesia"

Specifically, we look at how well proposals cover these dimensions: impact on society, impact on professionals, and impact on patients. We discuss three widely used approaches for such assessments: RE-AIM, MAST, and UTAUT. Our assessment showed careful selection of elements from all three models seems needed to sufficiently cover the dimensions. RE-AIM provides a broad framework; MAST adds aspects of transferability and ethics, and UTAUT adds perception of technology and future use. All these approaches lack pivotal aspects concerning inclusion of patients’ or citizens’ point of view in a study’s planning phase.

,,,"Building a Common Ground on the Clinical Case: Design, Implementation and Evaluation of an Information Model for a Handover EHR",Daniel Flemming,Mareike Paul and Ursula H?bner,"Handovers need a common ground on the clinical cases between the members of the successive shifts to establish continuity of care. Conventional electronic patient record systems (EHR) proved to be only insufficiently suitable for supporting the grounding process. Against this background we proposed a basic concept for a handover EHR that extends general EHRs in particular openEHR based systems. The resulting handover information model was implemented in a database and evaluated based on 120 clinical cases. The information items of these cases could be mapped successfully to the model, however, the new class “anticipatory guidance” needed to be introduced. The evaluation also demonstrated the importance of highly aggregated information on the clinical case, opinions and meta-information such as the relevance of an item during handovers. Based on these findings, in particular the handover database, handover EHR applications are currently developed to support the grounding process.","Handover, electronic health record, communication, common ground"

The aim in this project was to analyze how healthcare providers produce and receive information on a patient’s medication, and to identify opportunities to improve the quality, effectiveness, availability and collaboration of social and healthcare services in relation to medication information. The project focused on the most important points in patients’ medication management such as home care and care transitions. In a regional development project, data was gathered by interviews and a multi professional workshop. The study revealed that medication information reached only some professionals and lay caregivers despite electronic patient record (EPR) systems and tools. Differences in work processes related to medication reconciliation and information management were discussed in the group meeting and were regarded as a considerable risk for patient safety.","Medication management, regional development project, work process"
,Infrastructures to Support Big Data,,Representing Nursing Guideline with Unified Modeling Language to Facilitate Development of a Computer System: A Case Study,Jeeyae Choi,Jeungok E. Choi,"To provide best recommendations at the point of care, guidelines have been implemented in computer systems. As a prerequisite, guidelines are translated into a computer-interpretable guideline format. Since there are no specific tools to translate nursing guidelines, only a few nursing guidelines are translated and implemented in computer systems. Unified modeling language (UML) is a software writing language and is known to well and accurately represent end-users’ perspective, due to the expressive characteristics of the UML. In order to facilitate the development of computer systems for nurses’ use, the UML was used to translate a paper-based nursing guideline, and its ease of use and the usefulness were tested through a case study of a genetic counseling guideline. The UML was found to be a useful tool to nurse informaticians and a sufficient tool to model a guideline in a computer program.","Knowledge representation, Unified Modeling Language, Guideline, Ease-of-use, Usefulnss"

We have also identified three foci of the nursing observation and nursing action respectively. The foci of nursing observation are: “signs and symptoms related to the diseases”, “complications related to the invasive medical procedures such as surgery” and “adverse effects related to the pharmacotherapy”. Those of nursing action are: “nursing care to fulfill the needs arising from the diseases and the medical interventions”, “nursing care to prevent the complications”, and “nursing care to prevent the adverse effects”. Finally, we have categorized hospitalized patients’ conditions into “pre-surgery”, “postsurgery” and “rehabilitative phase” for the surgical patients and “severe”, “moderate” and “mild” for non-surgical ones. Using these frameworks, we have developed the structured knowledge model for a number of diseases and medical interventions.","Knowledge, quality assurance, patient care management, nursing informatics, structured knowledge, thinking process, professional judgment"

The methods were useful in identifying usability problems, and easy to employ using standard equipment and software thus a relatively low cost approach to usability testing.","telehealth, software designs, group processes"
,,,"Development and Implementation of IT Require Focus on User Participation, Acceptance and Workflow",Ina Koldkjær Sølling,Per Carøe and Kirsten Siggaard Mathiesen,"The study ”Online Care” follows a municipal project ”Online Welfare” where a nurse’s presence in the citizen's own home was replaced by online communication. The paper is based on a citizen’s perspective and seeks to develop meaningful workflow for the benefit of citizens with medical problems. The study examines five citizens’ opinions on whether online communication in a meaningful way supports the citizens in what they associate with a good life. In addition, relatives and the citizen’s nurse were interviewed individually concerning the same issues as the citizens. The study has been approved by the Danish System of Ethics in Science and is conducted in collaboration with Aalborg University, Aalborg Municipality and DanAge, (NGO). The municipality's goal of efficiency and financial savings regarding ”Online Welfare” was not honored due to insufficient network infrastructure and technical problems. An adoption barrier was that the municipality did not determine the efforts and the goal of the project, who could benefit from participating and the requirements of the professionals and the organization including ethical considerations.It was difficult to find citizens who were willing to participate. Citizens, who were included in the study accepted and adopted the technology however, ""Online Welfare"" could not replace the care they used to receive. Therefore, the offer was perceived as an ""appendix"" which tended to meaninglessness by some of the citizens.The nurses' perception of nursing care and their limited IT skills was a barrier to acceptance, adoption and development of technology opportunities in nursing. The citizens’ disability, the screen appearance, and the technology setup meant that the citizens perceived poor usability of the equipment. The study showed a change in workflow, as the cooperation between the citizen and the professional developed. New roles occurred for the professionals.The citizens had many ideas concerning the development of the technology and the study recommends that users are involved in the development and implementation of welfare technology and telemedicine. The relatively small sample size of the study shows findings that must be clarified by further research.","Home Nursing, Home Care, Online Care, Telemedicine, Online Communication, Workflow, Acceptance"

,,,The National Mobile Health Worker Project in England,Kathryn Drayton,Karen Robinson,"Community services provide essential care to many, often vulnerable, people, families and communities along the spectrum from health promotion to end of life care. The Mobile Health Worker Project is part of a larger project, the Transforming Community Services programme, which was established to support providers make changes to service provision that would provide better health outcomes, as well as increasing efficiency through the use of technology. This paper draws on the results of the two phase Mobile Health Worker project which involved 11 sites around England, the aim of which was to understand the requirements of mobile working. The results demonstrate that increased productivity and efficiency can be achieved by making changes to working processes. The project also provides guidance to increase the rate of mobile working adoption by providing a solid economic basis for investment in and deployment of mobile solutions to community organisations.","Community-based care, m-health, service delivery, efficiency"

The tool consists of an accelerometer that transfers data to an app on a Smartphone, which is subsequently connected to a server. Physical activity levels are measured in minutes per day compared to pre-set activity goals, which are set by patients in dialogue with nurses. Nurses can monitor patients’ physical activity via a secured website. The counseling protocol is based on the Five A’s model and consists of a limited number of behavior change consultations intertwined with interaction with and responses from the tool. The technology supports nurses when performing physical activity counseling. Provided that no connectivity problems occur, the It’s LiFe! intervention is feasible, and its longitudinal effects will be tested in a cluster RCT.","Physical activity, remote sensing technology, self-management support, primary care nursing"

Research has been conducted to identify which nursing students are at risk for not passing the NCLEX-RN test. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether any of several student covariates can be used to accurately identify associate in science in nursing (ASN) students that are at-risk for failing the NCLEX-RN test. Covariates included in the study were demographics, students’ pre-admission grade point average (GPA), the scores of test of essential skills (TEAS), and the assessment technologies institute® (ATI)’s comprehensive scores for a pre-RN examination test. Chi-squared automatic interaction detection, or CHAID analysis, was used to develop the model. One covariate, ATI comprehensive test scores, was found to accurately identify all at-risk ASN students. The model explained that students identified as “at-risk” had a failure rate nearly two-and-a-half times as high as the general population.","Decision tree, CHAID, NCLEX-RN, ASN"

This study challenges this view through an assessment of the degree to which the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP) might be used to provide raw data for the Belgian Nursing Minimum Data Set (B-NMDS). A mapping exercise identified exact matches between ICNP and BNMDS for just 8% of B-NMDS care descriptions; no matches at all for 23%; possible broader matches in ICNP for55%; possible narrower matches for 8%; and a possible broader and narrower match for 1%. Refining ICNP content and developing and implementing purposive data sets or catalogues that accommodate both ICNP concepts and B-NMDS care descriptions would lay the foundations for the potential re-use of primary ICNP-encoded data in populating the B-NMDS. One unexpected result of the study was to re-affirm the utility of ICNP as a reference terminology.","nursing, case mix, terminology, classification"

Ninety-one dialogues consisting of 284 messages were analysed. The communications between patients and the healthcare team revealed that the e-messages service served as a means for quality assurance of information, for double-checking and for coordination of care. We give examples of how an e-mail service may improve patients’ knowledge in a process of taking control over their own care ? increasingly important in a time of growing complexity and specialization in healthcare. It remains to be tested whether an e-message service can improve continuity of care and prevent or mitigate medical mishaps.","Continuity of care, Patient safety, Secure e-message service, Self-management."

,,,Rapid EHR Development and Implementation Using Web and Cloud-Based Architecture in a Large Home Health and Hospice Organization,Charlotte A. Weaver,Pamela Teenier,"Health care organizations have long been limited to a small number of major vendors in their selection of an electronic health record (EHR) system in the national and international marketplace. These major EHR vendors have in common base systems that are decades old, are built in antiquated programming languages, use outdated server architecture, and are based on inflexible data models [1,2]. The option to upgrade their technology to keep pace with the power of new web-based architecture, programming tools and cloud servers is not easily undertaken due to large client bases, development costs and risk [3]. This paper presents the decade-long efforts of a large national provider of home health and hospice care to select an EHR product, failing that to build their own and failing that initiative to go back into the market in 2012. The decade time delay had allowed new technologies and more nimble vendors to enter the market. Partnering with a new start-up company doing web and cloud based architecture for the home health and hospice market, made it possible to build, test and implement an operational and point of care system in 264 home health locations across 40 states and three time zones in the United States. This option of “starting over” with the new web and cloud technologies may be posing a next generation of new EHR vendors that retells the Blackberry replacement by iPhone story in healthcare.","Nursing informatics, cloud-based architectures, Point of Care systems, EHR in Home Health and Hospice, mobile computing"

,Mobile Healthcare,,mHealth Data Collector: An Application to Collect and Report Indicators for Assessment of Cardiometabolic Risk,Henrique Yoshikazu Shishido,Ricardo Alves da Cruz de Andrade and Gabrielle Jacklin Eler,"Traditional population surveys use paper forms that are filled manually by an interviewer. This process can take a long time; in comparison, computerizing the process reduces time, promotes safety and accuracy of data, improves patient care, and offers better control over the compiled information. From this perspective, it can be argued that mobile health supports mechanisms for the diagnosis, control, and prevention of metabolic diseases. In recent years, mobile devices have been applied in several health areas, such as remote monitoring, data logging, clinical decision-making, and with applications that can help maintain or initiate practices beneficial to individual health and wellbeing. However, there is a lack of applications for conducting population surveys. Thus, this work presents an application called mHealth Data Collector (mHDC) as a model for applications used in population surveys that contain such data as Body Mass Index (BMI), health- related issues, and health habit indicators. The design of this system occurred through interviews with health professionals who utilized a prototyping method to extract requirements. To develop this mobile app, the Android platform was adopted and the SQLite database was used to store patients’ health data. The JEx- celAPI and AchartEngine were also employed to generate spreadsheets and charts. The mHDC was tested using a case study in a Brazilian city. The results indicated that the health team took half the time to interview patients. In addition, the sys- tem has reduced the use of paper; centered and organized data; and allowed quick data recovery and standardization to improve the readability of data input. The mHDC proved efficient at collecting, analyzing, and safely exporting the results, thus reducing time collecting and analyzing the population survey.","Mobile health, Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases, Assessment"

Effective patient engagement demands short, yet valid instruments for measuring self-efficacy in various care dimensions. However, the static instruments are often too lengthy to be effective for assessment purposes. Furthermore, these tests could neither account for the dynamicity of measurements over time, nor differentiate care dimensions that are more critical to certain sub-populations. To remedy these disadvantages, we devise a dynamic instrument composition approach that can model the measurement of patient self-efficacy over time and iteratively select critical care dimensions and appropriate assessment questions based on dynamic user categorization. The dynamically composed instruments are expected to guide patients through self-management reinforcement cycles within or across care dimensions, while tightly integrated into clinical workflow and standard care processes.","Patient engagement, personalized care, dynamic assessment, patient education, self-efficacy measurement"

Secure and trusted use of these data, beyond their original purpose can change the way we think about business, health, education, and innovation in the years to come. “Big Data” is data whose scale, diversity, and complexity require new architecture, techniques, algorithms, and analytics to manage it and extract value and hidden knowledge from it.","Big data, Health IT, EHR, electronic health record, learning health system, digitization, datafication"
,,,Continuity of Care with HL7 v3 Care Record for Oncology Nursing,Mitchell Duim,Frank Boterenbrood and William T.F. Goossen,"The Clinical Data Ware House needs to meet three functions: reporting quality indicators, clinical research, and continuity of care. This paper reports on one function, namely the development and testing of data exchange for continuity of nursing care for oncology patients. The proof of principle was carried out using system analysis, requirements setting, system design, system development and experiment with the application of Health Level 7 version 3 Care Record electronic message. A successful testing of the Care Record message was conducted, using a case based data-subset for oncology nursing care including personal data, pain, weight and vital signs, among others. Conclusion: The development illustrated that the system components facilitate electronic data exchange from hospital to home care, allowing home care nurses to use received clinical data in their local system. In an incremental approach this data exchange can be enhanced to meet all data and all systems requirements.","electronic patient record, discharge summary, continuity of care, standards, HL7, nursing discharge message"
