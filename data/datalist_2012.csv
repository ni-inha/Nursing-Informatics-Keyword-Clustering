2012,,,A Case Study in Communication Strategies used for Pressure Ulcer Prevention in a Nursing Home with High IT Sophistication,Gregory L. Alexander,Richard Madsen,"Current strategies for improving the care of millions of elderly people living in nursing homes (NH) include the implementation of information technology (IT). Few studies exist about the implementation of NH IT although there is evidence of increasing NH IT sophistication globally. NH IT sophistication includes a measure of the maturity and diversity of IT used to support resident care, clinical support, and administration. The current paper includes a case study of 1 NH known to have high IT sophistication in the Midwestern USA. The NH was purposively selected from 185 NHs taking part in a statewide evaluation of NH IT sophistication in Missouri. This NH reported the highest IT sophistication among 185 NHs. The research aim was to explore communication strategies for evidence based pressure ulcer preventions in NH IT. Focus group and observational data were collected to assess facilitators and barriers to communicating pressure ulcer preventions.",

,,,Definition and Relational Specification of Work-around,Jennifer A. Browne,Carrie Jo Braden,"There are many investigations of nursing work-arounds reported in the literature.1?Despite numerous studies the concept remains vague and not logically linked to a theory base. Assumptions associated with many of these studies are not clearly articulated, leading to poor logic fit with analysis. Nursing literature reflects the assumptions that work-arounds are bad and must be eliminated. This paper defines work-around in its full range of variation consistent with a complex adaptive system base from two perspectives: essential attributes when operating as a mediator and as a moderator. Given the need for increased conceptual rigor in Nursing Informatics research, the moderator/mediator delineation is important. Moderating variables tend to be endemic to situations and are relatively resistant to intervention while mediating work-arounds may represent appropriate problem solving management of routine exceptions2?A clearer understanding of work-arounds can inform integration of the Electronic Health Record and safety, quality and efficiency initiatives.",

,,,SIGSAC Software: A tool for the Management of Chronic Disease and Telecare,Bustamante Claudia,"Alcayaga Claudia, Lange Ilta, Meza I?igo","Chronic disease management is highly complex because multiple interventions are required to improve clinical outcomes. From the patient’s perspective, his main problems are dealing with self-management without support and feeling isolated between clinical visits. A strategy for providing continuous self-management support is the use of communication technologies, such as the telephone. However, to be efficient and effective, an information system is required for telecare planning and follows up. The use of electronic clinical records facilitates the implementation of telecare, but those systems often do not allow to combine usual care (visits to the health clinics) with telecare. This paper presents the experience of developing an application called SIGSAC (Software de Informaci?n, Gesti?n y Seguimiento para el Autocuidado Cr?nico) for Chronic Disease Management and Telecare follow up.",

The study aim was to explore municipal nursing staff’s (n=30) perceptions of discharge information provided to them for stroke patients with eating difficulties. Structured interviews were used and data were analysed by content analysis and descriptive statistics. Results showed that nursing staff perceived informational continuity and accuracy of information on patients’ eating difficulties as poor and that little information on eating difficulties reached licensed practical nurses, who instead relied on their own assessments of patients’ eating ability. Co-ordinated care planning and management continuity were largely lacking, increasing the risk for undernutrition and related complications for the patients.",
,,,What Am I Giving Tonight? Information Needs of Nurses Related To Patient Medications Administration While Using a Clinical Information System,Kenrick D. Cato,Suzanne Bakken,"This study examined the information needs of nurses using a Clinical Information System (CIS) to review medications that they have to administer for their shift. In a laboratory setting, nurses were asked to follow a speak-aloud protocol while reviewing a scripted medication list. We coded the nurses’ information seeking behavior utilizing a previously described framework. Our findings suggest that 1) nurses predominately look through physician notes to gather clues in answering medication-related information needs and 2) nurses often leave the CIS to search other computerized sources for information about unfamiliar medications.",

,,,Factors influencing presence in virtual worlds,Meyrick C.M. Chow,,"Virtual worlds are showing potential as an effective platform for a variety of activities, including learning. The concept of presence (the sensation of “being there” in a mediated environment) has received substantial attention from the virtual reality community, and the effectiveness of virtual worlds has often been linked to the feelings of presence reported by their users. The present study examined the effects of attitude and perceived ease of use on sense of presence in Second Life, which is one of the most known and used virtual worlds. Based on data from a survey of 206 nursing students, hypotheses are empirically tested. Findings suggest that users’ attitude toward using Second Life and their perceived ease of use of it have a positive effect on their sense of presence in the virtual environment. This study advances our understanding of factors influencing presence in virtual worlds.",
,,,Using the LOINC Semantic Structure to Integrate Community-based Survey Items into a Concept-based Enterprise Data Dictionary to Support Comparative Effectiveness Research,"Manuel C. Co, Jr.","Bernadette Boden-Albala, Leigh Quarles, Adam Wilcox, Suzanne Bakken","In designing informatics infrastructure to support comparative effectiveness research (CER), it is necessary to implement approaches for integrating heterogeneous data sources such as clinical data typically stored in clinical data warehouses and those that are normally stored in separate research databases. One strategy to support this integration is the use of a concept-oriented data dictionary with a set of semantic terminology models.

,,,Workarounds Used by Nurses to Overcome Design Constraints of Electronic Health Records,Sarah A. Collins,"Matthew Fred, Lauren Wilcox, David K. Vawdrey","Adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to assist with clinical reasoning and streamline workflow; however, the data entry and review capabilities of most systems are suboptimal which may lead to workarounds. As an instance of a workaround, we examined nurses’ use of optional free-text comments in EHR flowsheets to support clinical needs for data interpretation. This mixed-method study included: 1) Content analysis of comments, 2) Interviews with nurses. We performed a sub-analysis of flowsheet data for 201 patients that experienced a cardiac arrest and interviewed 5 acute care nurses. We found that nurses used workarounds in the EHR - despite the extra effort that they required - to convey clinically significant relationships and to communicate concerning events to physicians. EHRs should better support entry of clinical data that “belongs together” and enable messaging capabilities integrated with nurses’ flowsheet documentation workflow.",

,,,A Framework for Harmonizing Terminologies to Support Representation of Nursing Practice in Electronic Records,Patricia C. Dykes,"Rebecca R. DaDamio, Hyeon-eui Kim",Nursing terminology development efforts in the United States and globally provide concept coverage across many domains of nursing practice. Efforts to integrate concepts from across terminology systems into a single reference terminology support broad concept coverage but do not provide a means to leverage the full benefits of the individual terminology systems. The purpose of this paper is to explore the feasibility of harmonizing the 198 Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System core intervention concepts with intervention concepts in the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP®) as a means to leverage both the information model components of the CCC system and the broad concept coverage of the ICNP®. Findings suggest that the CCC system and ICNP® are largely interoperable and a common framework underlying the two terminology systems provides a foundation for harmonization.,
,,,Does the Use of a Classification for Nursing Diagnoses Affect Nursing Students’ Choice of Nursing Interventions?,Joakim Falk,Catrin Bj?rvell,"The Swedish health care system stands before an implementation of standardized language. The first classification of nursing diagnoses translated into Swedish, The NANDA, was released in January 2011. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the usage of the NANDA classification affected nursing students’ choice of nursing interventions. Thirty-three nursing students in a clinical setting were divided into two groups. The intervention group had access to the NANDA classification text book, while the comparison group did not. In total 78 nursing assessments were performed and 218 nursing interventions initiated. The principle findings show that there were no statistical significant differences between the groups regarding the amount, quality or category of nursing interventions when using the NANDA classification compared to free text format nursing diagnoses.",

,,,Embracing an Integrated Personal Health Record for Continuity of Care,Grace Gao,Bonnie L. Westra,"There is a lack of information exchange for patients utilizing complementary and alternative therapies such as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) combined with conventional western medicine. Siloed health information can lead to potential problems for safe, quality care and optimal health. The Continuity of Care Document (CCD) is intended to be a subset of health data to exchange between providers and foundational for personal health records (PHR). It is unknown, however, about the relevance of CCD to represent TCM data for information exchange across different health systems. Four clinical data elements and related standards in CCD were evaluated for relevance to TCM providers and adequacy to represent TCM data. Project results indicate that even though standardized TCM-specific terminology and coding are lacking, the CCD data elements and standards are relevant to TCM providers. Recommendations are made for an integrated PHR containing both conventional western medicine and TCM following the CCD standard.",

,,,Altering the Function of the Electronic Medical Record: Creating a De-identified Database for Clinical Researchers and Educators,Jeffry S. Gordon,,"The electronic medical record (EMR) can be an excellent data source for creating real case based discussion, patient simulations for high and low fidelity simulators, and datasets for retrospective studies and quality improvement trend analysis. Faculty can use cases based on real data, not contrived data in their classrooms. Faculty and doctoral students can perform retrospective studies exploring treatment modalities without being encumbered with the actual processes of collecting and storing data, and quality improvement specialists can look at trending data to improve outcomes. The big problem with using general EMR systems as they are out of the box is patient identifiers need to be scrubbed from the record so it can be used for these purposes. This paper discusses the uses of de-identified datasets and gives an example of how this has happened at one university. Large amounts of real patient data are often needed in order for clinicians to solve the patient care situation. Traditional approaches of solving these problems consist of looking at summary statistics reported in professional settings such as journals and conferences. If a researcher was interested in a specific patient presentation they would collect data and report on the outcomes. If the instructor is both lucky and skilled enough to find the articles they want, they can answer their questions.",
,,,Benefits Realized through Usability Analysis of a Tele-nursing Call Management Software System at HealthLink BC,Simon A. S. Hall,"Amen S. Lalli, Andre W. Kushniruk, Elizabeth M.

This paper concludes with a description of how Plunket applied the guidance as part of the development of PlunketPlus.",
,,,Engineering a Learning Healthcare System: Using Health Information Technology to Develop an Objective Nurse Staffing Tool,Ellen M Harper,,"Nurses represent the largest proportion of direct healthcare providers. Overstaffed or understaffed units will have implications for the quality, cost, patient, and nurse satisfaction. It is vital that nurses are armed with appropriate instruments and data to help them plan and implement efficient and effective nursing teams. A compelling case is made for the association between nursing care and clinical, quality, and financial outcomes. Even though there is a great body of work on the correlation, there is little agreement on the best approach to determine the correct balance between the patient-to-nurse ratios. The sheer number of variables depicted in the literature suggests why precise evidenced based formulas are difficult to achieve. This paper will describe a practice based knowledge generation mixed methods study using detailed observation and electronic health record abstraction to generate a structural equation for use in predicting staffing needs.",

,,,Norwegian hospital nurses’ satisfaction with the electronic patient record and associations with informational continuity during shift changes,Ragnhild Hellesø,Ingeborg Strømseng Sjetne,"Electronic patient records are of importance to health care providers to ensure informational continuity. Here, we present a cross-sectional study in which 5455 nurses from 35 Norwegian hospitals answered a questionnaire in relation to a study of how their work environment ? including satisfaction with the electronic patient records system in use ? impacted patient safety. The survey data was analysed to test whether satisfaction with the patient records system varied between different groups of nurses, and to assess the association between satisfaction with the electronic patient records system and the nurses’ perception of informational continuity. We found group-wise differences that indicate that the electronic patient records systems could be improved, in addition to an association between satisfaction with the system and perceived informational continuity that confirms the role of electronic patient record systems in patient safety efforts.",
,,,Nursing Informatics in New Zealand: From History to Strategy,Michelle L.L. Honey,Lucy A.

The IKM health project aims at building information chain reference models for the care of patients with chronic wounds, cancer-related pain and back pain. Our question therefore was how to appropriately capture information and process requirements that are both generally applicable and practically useful. To this end, we started with recommendations from clinical guidelines and put them up for discussion in Delphi surveys and expert interviews. Despite the heterogeneity we encountered in all three methods, it was possible to obtain requirements suitable for building reference models. We evaluated three modelling languages and then chose to write the models in UML (class and activity diagrams). On the basis of the current project results, the pros and cons of our approach are discussed.",

,,,NI2012 Classification of Reasons for Hospital Readmission,Kay R. Jansen,,"Hospital readmission is a focus of efforts to improve quality and reduce cost in our healthcare system. Use of a standard readmission classification in a clinical information system would facilitate examination and analysis of reasons for hospital readmission and provide direction for targeting interventions. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to examine coverage of reasons for readmission in three existing classification schemes compared with a “gold standard” conceptual framework. Data were obtained from five data sources about reasons for readmission for a select group of patients using a modified Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) tool. Both the structure and the level of granularity of the three classifications had an impact on the classification of reasons. Between 53% and 65% of the reasons for readmission could be coded in the three readmission classifications, leaving 35% to 47% of the reasons uncoded, when compared with the conceptual framework.",
,,,Towards a Model Based Electronic Nursing Record,Niels Jansen,"Tino Bekkering, Alexander Ruber, Erik Gooskens, William T.F. Goossen","The electronic nursing record (ENR) as part of the larger electronic health record has been discussed for years. Its implementation is not that widespread as often considered. E.g. in the Netherlands, a fraction of hospitals uses it. This paper describes a nurse led project in a Dutch hospital where an electronic nursing record system has been defined, based on requirements analysis, standardization through Detail Clinical Models (DCM), and implementation. Standardization of data with DCM is a method and a format to organize clinical knowledge, concepts, and data elements such that managing and exchanging semantics of data is independent from specific technology. 28 DCM are used in the specifications of the ENR. Using the DCM standards approach and the mapping of data elements to professional terminologies enable a vendor to develop what is needed for quality care, rather then sell a fixed set product.","detail clinical models, DCM, electronic nursing record, nursing informatics, patient data, classifications"
,,,Use of the Isabel Decision Support System to Improve Diagnostic Accuracy of Pediatric Nurse Practitioner and Family Nurse Practitioner Students,Rita Marie John,"Elizabeth Hall, Suzanne Bakken","Patient safety is a priority for healthcare today. Despite a large proportion of malpractice claims the result of diagnostic error, the use of diagnostic decision support to improve diagnostic accuracy has not been widely used among healthcare professionals. Moreover, while the use of diagnostic decision support has been studied in attending physicians, residents, medical students and advanced practice nurses, the use of decision support among Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) students has not been studied. The authors have implemented the Isabel diagnostic decision support system into the curriculum and are evaluating its impact. The goals of the evaluation study are to describe the diagnostic accuracy and self-reported confidence levels of Pediatric Nurse Practitioner (PNP) and Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) students over the course of their programs, to examine changes in diagnostic accuracy and self-reported confidence levels over the study period, and to evaluate differences between FNP and PNP students in diagnostic accuracy and self-reported confidence levels for pediatric cases.

Kaufman","Older adults are being asked to play a more active role in the management of their health, however low health literacy is pervasive in this population and is a major impediment to participation in healthcare activities. We sought to identify literacy-related challenges that older adults experience while managing their health. We interviewed 8 nurses who provided direct care to older adult populations. Thematic analysis was conducted exploring barriers, strategies and resources as they relate to health literacy in older adults. Three main themes were identified: literacy barriers, aging process and social resources. Problems associated with health literacy in this population were pervasive. Numeracy, a component of health literacy, was a central factor for a range of medication management problems. However, nurses reported that they were able to fashion solutions that enabled patients to comprehend quantitative information and act on it accordingly, resulting in better health management.",
,,,Development of an Observational Tool to Measure Nurses’ Information Needs,Tiffany F. Kelley,Debra Brandon,"Nurses collect, communicate and store patient information needed for care through verbal, handwritten and electronic information sources. However, the specific categories of nurses’ information needs for the care of hospitalized patients remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify the categories of nurses’ information needs and develop an observational tool to measure the information needs through available information sources. We analyzed qualitative data from interview transcripts and conducted direct observations of nurses to identify a total of 17 categories of nurses’ information needs when caring for hospitalized patients. Once identified, we developed an observational tool to quantitatively measure the category of information need, whether the information need was collected and communicated, and through which information source. Future studies will be able to measure the gathering and communication of information needs through direct observation.",

,,,The National Nursing Model from the Nursing Practice Perspective ? Results from a Finnish Evaluation Study,Anne Kuusisto,"Johanna Kaipio, Pirkko Nyk?nen","The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the national nursing model in Finland. The feasibility evaluation was carried out with nurses using interviews and patient case scenarios in primary, specialized and private healthcare. The nursing process model showed to be feasible in nursing practice but the current national nursing classification (FinCC) was considered to be too detailed, multi-layered and difficult to understand and use. Overall, electronic nursing documentation improves the legal protection of patients and health professionals and makes nursing care transparent, but the nursing documentation systems do not support multi-professional care or information exchange. This study resulted in that the nursing model should conform better to nursing practices and support better nurses in their care interventions. An essential improvement for nursing practice would be specific templates that are easy to apply in specific situations with homogenous patient groups.","Nursing practice, nursing documentation, nursing classification, nursing documentation system"

,,,A Study on Visualizing the Twist and the Load on the Lumbar Region in Nursing Care,Yasuko Maekawa,"Akira Shiozaki, Yukie Majima","Most nurses suffer from lower back pain (LBP). The load on the lumbar region in nursing practice depends on patient's condition and situation. So we regard it as the load of nursing practice, and suggest visualizing the load on the lumbar region for nursing management. This study focuses on “twist” which is one of factors of LBP. We measured the twist angle of the lumbar region and the surface electromyogram (EMG) in three methods of transferring a patient from a bed to a wheelchair. Experimental subjects were seven women in their 20s and 30s who had learned the transferring technique. Measurement was performed using TRIAS system software (DKH Co., Ltd., Japan). The obtained signal data were analyzed using software (Matlab; The MathWorks, Inc.). We compared three methods, each of which was divided into four motions according to the experimental purpose. Results of visualizing the differences of the load on the lumbar region by twist angle, twist angular velocity and twist angular acceleration in each method could indicate nursing practice of the less load.",
,,,Developing a Conceptual Map of Patient Information Needs in Prostate Cancer Screening,Roxana M. Maffei,,"As the prevalence of shared decision-making increases as part of the patient-clinician relationship, patient needs for information become critical aspects of preventative care and treatment decisions. It has been shown that patients who have relevant information about healthcare options make choices and decisions which are more consistent with their personal values. This is especially useful when considering the various options regarding prostate cancer screening, (PCS). PCS remains extremely controversial given the uncertainty and lack of conclusive scientific evidence regarding the consequences of having the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test. It is vital that men are fully informed of the possible ramifications of the PSA test. The purpose of this study was to identify the information needs of male patients in PCS situations in primary care medical encounters. A deductive qualitative analysis was applied to uncover reoccurring themes and critical information presented by the subjects during conversations regarding PCS. From this analysis, a preliminary conceptual map was created in order to identify and understand the levels of information needed for patients to make informed PCS decisions. Future use and development of this map may improve PCS decisions by providing a structural approach to understanding the primary issues and implications of PCS for both the patient and clinician.",

,,,Nursing audit as a method for developing nursing care and ensuring patient safety,Minna Mykk?nen,"Kaija Saranto, Merja Miettinen","Nursing documentation is crucial to high quality, good and safe nursing care. According to earlier studies nursing documentation varies and the nursing classifications used in electronic patient records (EPR) is not yet stable internationally nor nationally. Legislation on patient records varies between countries, but they should contain accurate, high quality information for assessing, planning and delivering care. A unified national model for documenting patient care would improve information flow, management between multidisciplinary care teams and patient safety. Nursing documentation quality, accuracy and development needs can be monitored through an auditing instrument developed for the national documentation model. The results of the auditing process in one university hospital suggest that the national nursing documentation model fulfills nurses’ expectations of electronic tools, facilitating their important documentation duty. This paper discusses the importance of auditing nursing documentation and especially of giving feedback after the implementation of a new means of documentation, to monitor the progress of documentation and further improve nursing documentation.",

,,,Supporting Nurses’ Decisions with a Multi-Attribute Model for Patient Health Evaluation,Uro? Rajkovi?,"Dejan Dinevski, Olga ?u?ter?i?, Vesna Prijatelj, Vladislav Rajkovi?","Nurses are required to make many important decisions, for instance on determining the level of the nursing problem, setting nursing diagnoses and interventions. The model presented in this paper is a tool for better and easier decision making is such situations. Multi-attribute modeling of patients’ basic living activities is used for evaluation and explanation of their health status. It offers also visualization and quantification of the data which facilitate decision making in the framework of the process work method. The model can be viewed as an active check-list as it helps us reduce the possibility of “overlooking the queen on the chess board”. The model was critically evaluated in practice.","Decision support for nurses, Multi-attribute modeling, Basic living activities, Patient’s health status"
,,,DIGITAL CLINICAL DATA:?A Contribution of Instituto Traumatologico de Santiago de Chile to Hospital Management,Mario Reyes,Mario Molina,"Instituto Traumatol?gico developed an innovative project to gather clinical data in a digital format, thus generating the information necessary to make decisions. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide our patients with the best attention possible. The impact of incorporating health care informatics to a hospital’s daily routine is profound, especially when those who are in charge of change have not learned about this topic or encouraged their students to incorporate new technologies to their work. The results of this project become even more significant when it is implemented in Latin American public hospitals, where the resources invested in technology are scarce. The success of this project could be considered a case of study for the region and the country. Although many efforts and resources have been invested in systematizing information, few cases have shown positive results. This project started with the systematization of the process of attention at the Emergency Department and the adaptation of the Emergency Information System. Once the implementation of this system was over, the project was applied to install the Polyclinic Information System, and Hospitalization Information Systems. The Electronic Health Record includes interfaces for specialties such as upper limbs, spine, hips and lower limbs, which makes it easier for specialists to handle the required information. The large amount of recollected data has been translated into statistic charts and indicators, which support the administration processes that take place in intermediate and superior areas of the Institute.","Health Informatics, Health Informatics Education, Medical Informatics System, Clinical Informatics System, Health Informatics System"

Based on results of the present study, a set of recommendations provide for development of a comprehensive nursing portal in Iran.",
,,,The digital divide: Trends in global mobile and broadband Internet access from 2000?2010,Charlene Ronquillo,Leanne Currie,"The digital divide is described as the gap between those who do and do not have access to digital information and communications technologies (ICT). ICTs are viewed as an indicator of infrastructure and potential for development, and are a growing platform for health information and services delivery. This study compares the penetration of mobile and broadband Internet technologies by global region from 2000 to 2010. Results illustrate the rapid growth of mobile cellular telephone subscriptions in all global regions with trends suggesting a continued increase. Little to modest gains were made in fixed broadband Internet subscriptions globally. There is a growing popularity of mobile subscriptions with use of data communications, exceeding the numbers of fixed Internet subscriptions. This comparison reveals current strengths that can be built on and highlights the importance of awareness of global trends and using such knowledge to inform design and delivery of ICT-based health services.",
,,,Health Assets in Nursing Documentation of Cancer Care.,Ann Kristin Roteg?rd,"May Solveig Fagermoen, Cornelia M. Ruland","Patients’ experiences, knowledge and preferences, as well as more person-centered care need to be implemented in clinical support systems and are central values and outcomes of eHealth. Health assets represent such information. The concept of health assets was explored and described based on analysis of nursing documentation in cancer patients’ records. A convenience sample from 100 records, available from a larger study, resulted in 43 records that met the inclusion criteria. These were analyzed using content analysis methods. A mean of 3.2 health assets was documented in these records, and 61% of the descriptions of assets quoted patients. Assets were found most often in the admission notes (49%), but no information was found that described or indicated an intended use or follow up in the nursing documentation.",
,,,Whose Voices are Heard in Patient Safety Incident Reports?,Kaija Saranto,"David W. Bates, Minna Mykk?nen, Mikko H?rk?nen, Merja Miettinen","Patient safety incident reporting systems are used to monitor adverse events, generate information for risk management and to improve patient safety. A number of electronic reporting systems have been developed, but their data elements appear relatively similar. An inductive data analysis was carried out to find out especially what is the content of descriptions of contributing factors of adverse events. The data consisted of incident reports entered in a hospital based reporting system in the years 2008?2010. Overall, 82 reports of 785 contained free text information about patients’ and relatives’ involvement in the events reported by staff. We found that patients themselves noticed almost half of these incidents. Of the incidents they noticed, most resulted in moderate harm.",
,,,Barriers and Facilitators of Implementing Electronic Data Summaries in HIV/AIDS Care,Rebecca Schnall,"Ann B. Smith, Peter Gordon, Eli Camhi, Manik Sikka, Tim Kanter, Suzanne Bakken","The purpose of this study was to describe case managers’ perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to implementing two different electronic data summaries (EDS), a USB-based and Web-based Continuity of Care Document (CCD) for patients living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) in New York City. The primary aim of this descriptive qualitative study was to understand case managers’ perceptions of the two systems. Focus group methodology was used to gather perceptions from 48 participants. Major themes by factor included: barriers (technical difficulties, quality of data, and confidentiality breaches), and facilitators (training/ user support, work efficiency, and improved coordination of care). EDSs may be particularly useful in improving coordination of services and information sharing for HIV case managers. Careful attention must be paid to barriers and facilitators for use of these EDSs so that they can best meet the healthcare and social service needs of PLWH.",
,,,Nursing Routine Data as a Basis for Association Analysis in the Domain of Nursing Knowledge,Bj?rn Sellemann,"J?rgen Stausberg, Ursula H?bner","This paper describes the data mining method of association analysis within the framework of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) with the aim to identify standard patterns of nursing care. The approach is application-oriented and used on nursing routine data of the method LEP nursing 2. The increasing use of information technology in hospitals, especially of nursing information systems, requires the storage of large data sets, which hitherto have not always been analyzed adequately. Three association analyses for the days of admission, surgery and discharge, have been performed. The results of almost 1.5 million generated association rules indicate that it is valid to apply association analysis to nursing routine data. All rules are semantically trivial, since they reflect existing knowledge from the domain of nursing. This may be due either to the method LEP Nursing 2, or to the nursing activities themselves. Nonetheless, association analysis may in future become a useful analytical tool on the basis of structured nursing routine data.",
,,,Approaches to Workflow Analysis in Healthcare Settings,Barbara Sheehan,Suzanne Bakken,"Attention to workflow is an important component of a comprehensive approach to designing usable information systems. In healthcare, inattention to workflow is associated with poorly accepted systems and unforeseen effects of use. How best to examine workflow for the purpose of system design is in itself the subject of scientific inquiry. Several disciplines offer approaches to the study of workflow that can be tailored to meet the needs of systems designers in healthcare settings. This paper will describe several methodologies for workflow analysis according to the major schools of thought from which they have been developed. The level of workflow they examine and their theoretical underpinnings will also be described.",
,,,Comparing the Effectiveness of CDSS on Provider’s Behaviors to Implement Obesity Prevention Guidelines,Diane J Skiba,"Bonnie Gance-Cleveland, Kevin Gilbert, Lynn Gilbert, Danielle Dandreaux","Obesity is a global epidemic demanding the use of clinical decision support tools to help clinicians in the identification, assessment and management of healthy weight gain in children. Over the last decade, numerous systematic reviews have shown that clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have positively impacted clinician’s performance for drug ordering/dosing and preventive care reminders. CDSS that are built into the clinician’s workflow at the point of care also have a positive impact on provider’s performance. There are limited studies that examine CDSS in nursing practice. This paper describes a comparative effectiveness study being conducted in school-based clinics to examine the impact of web-based training with and without a CDSS that contains tailored recommendations. The study involves the use of a CDSS tool focused on cardiovascular risks, HeartSmartKids™. This research is an important example of an interdisciplinary team using information technology to address the global issue of obesity prevention.",
,,,Evaluating the Impact of Electronic Health Records on Nurse Clinical Process at Two Community Health Sites,Paulina S. Sockolow,"Cindy Liao, Jesse L. Chittams, Kathryn H. Bowles","We conducted two mixed methods studies in community-based health care settings to examine EHR use among nurses documenting direct patient care and EHR impact on nurse satisfaction. Quantitative methods included documentation time-to-completion data and a clinician satisfaction survey. Qualitative methods included observations and follow-up interviews. Qualitative data was merged with the quantitative data by comparing findings along themes. Results indicated nurses increased the number and timeliness of notes documented. Nurse use of the EHR as intended varied between the research sites. Barriers to EHR use included cumbersome functionalities that impacted nurse efficiency, lack of interoperability, and hardware issues. Facilitators to adoption included functionalities that provided memory prompts during the care process and enabled nurses to communicate about patient care. Interpretation of findings underscores the importance of the interaction of workflow, EHR functionality, and usability to impact nurse satisfaction, efficiency, and use of the EHR.",
,,,Nursing Minimum Data Set Based on EHR Archetypes Approach,Dandara N. Spigolon,Cl?udia M.C. Moro,"The establishment of a Nursing Minimum Data Set (NMDS) can facilitate the use of health information systems. The adoption of these sets and represent them based on archetypes are a way of developing and support health systems. The objective of this paper is to describe the definition of a minimum data set for nursing in endometriosis represent with archetypes. The study was divided into two steps: Defining the Nursing Minimum Data Set to endometriosis, and Development archetypes related to the NMDS. The nursing data set to endometriosis was represented in the form of archetype, using the whole perception of the evaluation item, organs and senses. This form of representation is an important tool for semantic interoperability and knowledge representation for health information systems.",
,,,Standardization of Patient Registries for Improved Data Collection and Outcome Measurement,Christine M. Spisla,Cynthia B. Lundberg,"Patient registries provide key data for clinical trials, patient safety and disease progression research. Current standards are insufficient to guide consistent authoring and reuse of registry questions. An outcome measure and its accompanying measurable indicators provide the means for the collection of data over a continuum of care. These data can be translated into comparison research, supporting the development of evidence-based knowledge. Lack of standardized approach to question/answer authoring and identification of outcome measure indicators have been an obstacle to interoperability of registry data with electronic medical and personal health records.",
,,,Promoting Usability in Organizations with a New Health Usability Model: Implications for Nursing Informatics,Nancy Staggers,Melanie Rodney,"Usability issues with products such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are of global interest to nursing informaticists. Although improvements in patient safety, clinical productivity and effectiveness are possible when usability principles and practices are in place, most organizations do not embrace usability. This paper presents a new Health Usability Maturity Model consisting of 5 phases: unrecognized, preliminary, implemented, integrated and strategic. Within each level various aspects are discussed including focus on users, management, education, resources, processes and infrastructure. Nurse informaticists may use this new model as a guide for assessing their organization’s level of usability and transitioning to the next level. Using tactics outlined here, nurse informaticists may also serve as catalysts for change and lead efforts to improve the user experience in organizations across industry, academe and healthcare settings.",
,,,The Development of Remote Monitoring and Guideline System for Safer Client Care in the Community,Winnie Sun,Diane Doran,"There is increasing concern to support older adults who want to live independently in their own homes. The purpose of this study is to investigate the integration of two non-intrusive approaches to monitoring home care clients activity level, along with access to best practice guidelines for clinicians at the point of care. A prototype Remote Activity Monitoring and Guidelines System has been developed that uses a GPS-equipped BlackBerry to monitor a person’s mobility outside the home. The System includes a pressure-sensitive mat that is placed under a regular bed mattress and can monitor sleep disturbances, and how long it takes to enter and exit the bed. This research study provided valuable information about the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating bio-mobility information obtained through remote monitoring with decision support technologies to support safer client care for seniors.",
,,,"A survey of nursing documentation, terminologies and standards in European countries",Asta Thoroddsen,"Anna Ehrenberg, Walter Sermeus, Kaija Saranto","A survey was carried out to describe the current state of art in the use of nursing documentation, terminologies, standards and education. Key informants in European countries were targeted by the Association for Common European Nursing Diagnoses, Interventions and Outcomes (ACENDIO). Replies were received from key informants in 20 European countries. Results show that the nursing process was most often used to structure nursing documentation. Many standardized nursing terminologies were used in Europe with NANDA, NIC, NOC and ICF most frequently used. In 70% of the countries minimum requirements were available for electronic health records (EHR), but nursing not addressed specifically. Standards in use for nursing terminologies and information systems were lacking. The results should be a major concern to the nursing community in Europe. As a European platform, ACENDIO can play a role in enhancing standardization activities, and should develop its role accordingly.",

,,,Service Desk Calls in a Home-based Clinical Informatics Study: Supporting End Users in the Field,RS Valdez,"LJ Burke, GR Casper, BA Sturgeon, C Rosmait, D Palzkill, D Hamann, J Murphy, PF Brennan","Home-based clinical informatics technologies are being developed to facilitate health care provision and management. Given the novelty of these technologies, end users such as patients and their formal and informal caregivers may require support during use. This paper presents a case study within the United States of the service desk calls generated over a 31-month period by patients enrolled in a large randomized field experiment, HeartCare II. This case study provides future deployers of home-based clinical information technologies with an understanding of the types of support that may be required during use. Our analysis reveals that calls to the service desk originated as a result of user problems, hardware problems, software problems, and internal communication problems among individuals involved in the delivery and use of the technology. Implications of these needs for support during use are also discussed.",

,,,Extending Nurse Practitioner Care Using the Virtual Reality World of Second Life,Elizabeth E. Weiner,"Tom Elasy, Nancy M. Lorenzi, Ryan McNew, Laura Shackleford, Kathleen Wolff, Stephanie Martin, Christy Benson","The growth of Internet applications has substantially broadened the potential for its use in global telehealth. This pilot project used the virtual reality world of Second Life for diabetic patients to meet with their nurse practitioners for their maintenance visits. Using avatars and the online patient portal, these scheduled visits were designed to meet the needs of the patients as determined by the results from a questionnaire completed by patients prior to the visit. The virtual visits took place in the replicated building where patients typically receive their care, the Eskind Diabetes Clinic. Orientation sessions to Second Life were made available prior to the actual visit, and additional online resources were made available after the visit was over. Although only seven pilot patients have currently completed visits, data illustrate the positive potential use of this treatment modality for future study.",
,,,A Taxonomy for Contextual Information in Electronic Health Records,Charlene R. Weir,"Nancy Staggers, Kristina Doing-Harris, Robert Dunlea, Teresa McCormick, Robyn Barrus","Contextual information is functional, social and financial information about patients and is central to many health-care decisions, including end-of-life care, living arrangements, and the aggressiveness of treatment. It is the language of patients when talking about their health and frequently the focus of nursing interventions. In this study, we report the results of a qualitative analysis of interviews of 17 clinicians focusing on their use of contextual information during the process of care, decision-making and documentation. We identified seven characteristics of contextual information relevant to its use in a clinical setting. Implications for Natural Language Processing and Ontology construction are discussed.",
,,,Changes in nurses’ work associated with computerised information systems: Opportunities for international comparative studies using the revised Work Observation Method By Activity Timing (WOMBAT),Johanna I. Westbrook,"Nerida J. Creswick, Christine Duffield, Ling Li, William T. M. Dunsmuir","An important step in advancing global health through informatics is to understand how systems support health professionals to deliver improved services to patients. Studies in several countries have highlighted the potential for clinical information systems to change patterns of work and communication, and in particular have raised concerns that they reduce nurses’ time in direct care. However measuring the effects of systems on work is challenging and comparisons across studies have been hindered by a lack of standardised definitions and measurement tools. This paper describes the Work Observation Method by Activity Time (WOMBAT) technique version 1.0 and the ways in which the data generated can describe different aspects of health professionals’ work. In 2011 a revised WOMBAT version 2.0 was developed specifically to facilitate its use by research teams in different countries. The new features provide opportunities for international comparative studies of nurses’ work to be conducted.",
,,,“You Are Not at All Bothersome” ? Nurses’ Online Communication with Testicular Cancer Patients,Torunn Wibe,"Mirjam Ekstedt, Ragnhild Hellesø, Cecilie Varsi, Cornelia Ruland","To some extent, electronic communication has supplemented nurses’ face-to-face contact with patients over the last few years. In this paper, we report findings from a study in which we examined cancer nurses’ answers to messages from testicular cancer patients in a nurse-managed online patient-provider communication service. The aim of the study was to investigate how nurses manage to meet patients’ different questions and concerns, and what aspects of expert nursing care are demonstrated when they communicate with patients online. The content of the messages formed a continuum from practical to existential issues. In their answers, the nurses demonstrated an ability to make reflected choices between both support modalities and means of communication. The professional knowledge and care of expert cancer nurses were clearly exposed in the nurses’ answers, although they were good at adapting their professional language so that it would be understandable to the patients.",
,,,Current Practices in Clinical Analytics: A Hospital Survey Report,Dana M. Womack,"Rosemary Kennedy, Bill Bria","Clinical analytics must become a pervasive activity in healthcare settings to achieve the global vision for timely, effective, equitable, and excellent care. Global adoption of the Electronic Health Record (EHR) has increased the volume of data available for performance measurement and healthcare organizational capacity for continuous quality improvement. However, EHR adoption does not automatically result in optimal use of clinical data for performance improvement. In order to understand organizational factors related to use of data for clinical analytics, a survey was conducted of hospitals and hospital-based clinics. The survey revealed sub-optimal use of data captured as a byproduct of care delivery, the need for tools and methodologies to assist with data analytics, and the need for disciplined organizational structure and strategies. Informatics nurse professionals are well-positioned to lead analytical efforts and serve as a catalyst in their facility’s transformations into a data-driven organization.",
