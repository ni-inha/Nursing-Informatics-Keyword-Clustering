,,Paper,Patient Accessible Electronic Health Records: Impacts on Nursing Documentation Practices at a University Hospital,Berglind Fjola Smaradottir,,"In a Norwegian health region, patients have online access to their own electronic health record and they can also read the nursing documentation. This paper presents a qualitative study made at a university hospital to investigate how patient accessible electronic health records impact on nursing documentation practices. Semi-structured interviews were made with 12 informants from 5 cardiology departments at one hospital regarding how they used electronic nursing documentation in their daily practice and how they experienced patient accessible nursing documentation. The nurses emphasized that they focused on a clear and wellwritten nursing documentation, but in some situations, they were hesitant to write sensitive information. The study concluded that the implementation of patients’ reading access to the electronic health record had limited impact on the nursing documentation and the daily practice at the departments, but the nursing handover had an even more important function for oral exchange of information.","Electronic Health Records, Nursing Practice, Nursing Informatics"

Due to the capability of continuous and unobtrusive monitoring, the sensor-enhanced in-home monitoring is regarded as a promising solution to support aging in place. In this paper, by reviewing three influential projects in this field of in-home monitoring for aging in place, we present our opinions and suggestions on the development of informatics-supported aging in place for its practical application in healthcare such as diagnosis and nursing in the era of data science. To promote the practical usage of in-home monitoring in aging, we highlight the gap between demands and available approaches. We conclude that in the next stage we should design demand-oriented system, conduct evidencebased research and accelerate interdisciplinary collaboration.","Independent living, aging in place, assisted living facilities."

We verified whether clinical staff could distinguish between these two types of falls by comparing 3,078 free-text incident reports about falls using a natural language processing technique and a machine learning technique. Common terms were used in reports for both types of falls, but the similarity score between the two types of reports was low, and the performance of identification based on the classification model constructed by support vector machine and deep learning was low. Although it is possible that adjustment of hyper parameters during construction of the classification model was required, we believe that clinical staff cannot distinguish between the two types of falls and do not record the distinction in incident reports.","Accidental Falls, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning"

The home care admission often starts without important information needed for formulation of the plan of care. We conducted a mixed methods analysis to investigate home care admission information from two perspectives: qualitative information regarding information nurses reported they needed during an admission, and quantitative information regarding information actually available. We mapped both data sets to an international specification for transitions in care information, the Continuity of Care Document (CCD). The information that homecare nurses said they needed mapped sufficiently (90%) to the CCD. Regarding available information: no observation had all the CCD information present; CCD information was missing in varying amounts across the admission documents.

Lack of feedback and supportive information prohibits reporters benefitting from the purpose and lowers their motivation, which may result in underreporting and low-quality reporting. It is even more challenging to report an insulin-use event with high data quality due to the complex nature of insulin use. In this project, we proposed a framework to discover supportive information from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), an open data source, to enhance the reporting of insulin-use events. The medications associated with insulin-use events and frequent reactions contained in insulin-use events manifested in FAERS are discovered. The information would be of significance in distinguishing medication names, optimizing adverse event description terms and improving report completeness.

Most published predictive models have used only patient level data from either single-center studies or secondary data analysis of randomized control trials. This study describes a hierarchical model that captures regional differences in addition to patient-level data from 1778 unique patients across 31 geographically distributed hospitals from one health system. The model was developed using Bayesian techniques operating on a large set of predictors. It provided Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.64 for the validation cohort.

,,Poster,Design of an Observation Support System to Improve Pain Management,Ryoma Seto,Toshitaka Inoue and Takahiro Yasoshima,"We were challenged to design an obeservation support system. To improve evidence-based observations, we anylysed nursing records from electronic medical records (EMR) and patient experiences (from blogs) regarding pain symptoms using text mining methods. As a result, it was found that the view point of pain differed between the patient and nurse. It is reccomended that an observation advice message should be inplemented into EMR to improve nurses’ observations on pain management.","Electronic Health Records, Nursing Records, Pain Management"
,,Poster,Predicting Long-Term Mortality with Biomarkers Level for Homecare Patients,Ying-Ju Chen,"Meng-Ting Tsou, Chung-Lieh Hung, Wen-Ling Chang and Pei-Hung Liao","Electronic health record (EHR) systems have been used widely in research. However, most of the EHRs are highly dimensional and it is challenging to analyze such large data set. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary science with a focus on data management and interpretation for complex biological phenomena. We investigated biomarkers of nutrition from 3001 patients. Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios of mortality were calculated according to both albumin and sodium levels. We explore the association of aging predicted by all-cause mortality in future.","Nursing, Biomarker, Mortality"
,,Poster,The Study of Hotspots on Nursing Dissertation Based on Co-Word Analysis in China,W. Zhang,"Y.N. Xing, J. Cheng and H.M. Duan","All the doctoral dissertations and master's theses of ""nursing” in CNKI database were retrieved to explore the hot spots on nursing research field in China, we processed, visualized the data above, and analyzed those data by using co-word analysis informetrics method. Then, the figure for co-occurrence analysis of highfrequency keywords in dissertation on nursing research were plotted, which represented nine topics and could help health staff to understand hot topics in nursing research field.",Nursing research; Co-word analysis; Dissertation;

Logic allows to formalize the deductive study of sorge knowledge in order to determine what are the dimensions of care. These dimensions will be the guiding framework in the analysis of big data contained in health information systems.,"Care, Concept formation, Information Systems"
