2021,Data Analytics and the Use of Nursing Data,Paper,Analyzing the Scientific Community Focused on Nursing Informatics Using Publication Data,Ulrich Schrader,,"The scientific community focused on nursing informatics can be described as a graph with the authors as vertices and the author-coauthor relationship as the connecting edges. Methods to describe and analyze networks like average path length, diameter, centrality measures, or partitioning into subcommunities are applied to the nursing informatics community. It is shown that the community consists of one large connected subnet with many small disjoint subnets, each representing one or several authors. The interconnectivity of the large subnet is quite high indicating an information flow along several different paths. Using different centrality measures important authors for e.g. the information flow can be identified. While each small disjoint subnet represents a small sub-community, the large central subnet can also be partitioned into subcommunities connected with each other. Some seem to be focused on specific aspects of nursing informatics.","Data analytics, publications, Pubmed, scientific community"

Although usability engineering methods have been applied in the design and evaluation of health care software, available heuristics focus on task-work aspects and do not address stigma associated with many health conditions. We used a previous set of heuristics and propose a new set of anti-stigma heuristics to evaluate stigmatization in health care websites. The extended set of heuristics were concurrently applied in a heuristic evaluation and a cognitive walkthrough to evaluate an endometriosis and sexual pain website. The walkthrough involved 5 tasks that required 21 actions to execute. Twenty-six usability problems were identified and recommendations for re-design were made to the design team before end-user testing. The anti-stigma heuristics received worse ratings than the traditional heuristics, resulting in several design changes that might otherwise have been missed. Thus, the new anti-stigma heuristics were a valuable contribution.","Cognitive walkthrough, heuristic evaluation, anti-stigma heuristics, endometriosis, sexual pain, user interface, nursing informatics"

The use of automated dispensing cabinets (ADC) in clinical areas may reduce the occurrence of medications being unavailable at the time of need by alerting pharmacy to replenish stock. However, workarounds in ADC use can affect this capability. We studied nurses’ use of an ADC in a paediatric intensive care unit with ~54 hours of observation, semi-structure interviews (19 nurses; 4 pharmacy/management staff) and review of reported incidents. We found running out of medication a recurrent problem despite the ADC. Contributing factors affecting data entry in the ADC, and therefore replenishment alerts to pharmacy, included: the organisation of medication activities in the ward, nurses’ information needs, patients’ medication needs, and ADC design. Running out of medications was a ‘tragedy of the commons’. Effective solutions may require going beyond user training and directives for accurate data entry, to work process redesign.","Medication systems, automation, patient safety, systems thinking"

To simplify such text, this paper explored how word and character level information can be leveraged to identify medical terms when training data is limited. We created a dataset of medical and general terms using the Human Disease Ontology from BioPortal and Wikipedia pages. Our results from 10-fold cross validation indicated that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers perform competitively. The best F score of 93.9% was achieved by a CNN trained on both word and character level embeddings. Statistical significance tests demonstrated that general word embeddings provide rich word representations for medical term identification. Consequently, focusing on words is favorable for medical term identification if using deep learning architectures.","Terminology, text simplification, deep learning, word embedding"

A Literature Review,Saba Akbar,David Lyell and Farah Magrabi,"The use of computerized decision support systems (DSS) in nursing practice is increasing. However, research about who uses DSS, where are they implemented, and how they are linked with standards of nursing is limited. This paper presents evidence on users and settings of DSS implementation, along with specific nursing standards of practice that are facilitated by such DSS. We searched six bibliographic databases using relevant terms and identified 28 studies, each evaluating a unique DSS. Of these, 24 were used by registered nurses and 19 were implemented in short-term care units. Most of the DSS were found to facilitate nursing standards of assessment and intervention, however, outcome identification and evaluation were the least included standards.

Regulatory organizations have mandated hospitals to submit monthly surveillance reports. However, there is an inaccuracy of presenting this report because of the lack of data standardization. This descriptive qualitative study aimed to develop a CLABSI prevention Information Model (IM) so the CLABSI prevention guidelines can be incorporated into structured nursing documentations. The flowsheet metadata stored in the Clinical Decision Repository was analyzed using an advanced analytics tool. The CLABSI prevention flowsheet data were mapped to 25 concepts, 45 data attributes and over 200 data value sets after organizing hierarchical structures. Seven domains of CLABSI prevention were identified in a CLABSI prevention IM. It would provide tangible benefits to create a practice reminder of the high risk for CLABSIs based on the nursing flowsheet data sets and multidisciplinary Electronic Health Record (EHR).","Central-line associated blood stream infection, information model, concept mapping"
